# README

This repository or distribution features the document named
**Muldis Data Language** (**MDL**)
and its supporting documents.

The **Muldis Data Language** document is currently being rewritten,
and also had prior rewrites.

This is the newest version, which is mostly empty as of this writing:

- [spec/Muldis_Data_Language.md](spec/Muldis_Data_Language.md)

But the externally defined **Muldis Object Notation** (**MUON**)
repository/document, which is complete as of this writing,
is effectively a substantial component of **MDL** itself,
which was split off because it is independently useful:

- <https://github.com/muldis/Muldis_Object_Notation>

This is the newest **MDL** version's predecessor,
named for the year 2018 when the last major work on it was done;
most of it has not yet been rewritten:

- [spec_2018/Muldis_Data_Language.md](spec_2018/Muldis_Data_Language.md)

This is the 2018 **MDL** version's predecessor,
named for the year 2011 when the last major work on it was done;
a large portion of it has not yet been rewritten:

- [spec_2011/Muldis_Data_Language.md](spec_2011/Muldis_Data_Language.md)

These documents have some supplemental material:

- [See_Also.md](See_Also.md)
- [Referrers.md](Referrers.md)
