=head1 NAME

Muldis::D::See_Also - External resources that you really ought to look at

=head1 VERSION

This document is Muldis::D::See_Also version 0.300.0.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See L<Muldis::D> first to read the B<Muldis D> language meta-specification.

This document is a central location within the L<Muldis::D>
distribution where any important recommendations of or links to external
resources go.  This includes both resources that were helpful in making
Muldis D, as well as resources that are or could be related to Muldis D.

=head1 CURRENT IMPLEMENTATIONS OF MULDIS D

These externally distributed projects are full or partial implementations
of the Muldis D language.

=over

=item B<Muldis D Reference Engine for Perl> - L<Muldis::D::Ref_Eng>

This is the first full implementation of Muldis D that is intended for
production use, written in Perl by Muldis Data Systems, Inc., and
licensed under the Apache License version 2.  It is a full-fledged
language implementation intended to be used in the same manner as "perl"
itself, where a "muldisdre" binary exists that is used to compile or run
Muldis D Plain Text source code ("foo.mdpt" files).  Alternately, its bulk
is a Perl module that lets Muldis D be used directly by Perl programs
as a sub-language in the same manner as the Perl DBI module; moreover,
users would typically specify Muldis D code in a Hosted Data format
consisting of native Perl data structures.

=item B<Set::Relation for Perl> - L<Set::Relation>

Set::Relation provides a simple Perl-native facility for an application to
organize and process information using the relational model of data,
without having to employ a separate DBMS, and without having to employ a
whole separate language (such as Muldis::D::Ref_Eng does).  Rather, it is
integrated a lot more into the Perl way of doing things, and you use it
much like a Perl array or hash, or like some other third-party Set::
modules available for Perl.  This is a standalone Perl object class that
represents a Muldis D relation value, and its methods implement all
the Muldis D relational operators.  It is intended for production use, is
written by Muldis Data Systems, Inc., and is licensed under the
Apache License version 2.

=item B<Set::Relation for Raku>

This is the Raku version of the same-named Perl module.  This version
as it currently exists is actually a lot older than the Perl one, and the
Perl one is a rewrite of it.  In the near future, the current Perl
module may be ported to Raku again to replace it, unless there's no point
in the face of a more useful Muldis::D::Ref_Eng port.

=back

=head1 PROSPECTIVE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF MULDIS D

These externally distributed projects are full or partial implementations
of the Muldis D language.

=over

=item B<Muldis D Reference Engine for Not Quite Perl>

The Muldis D Reference Engine would also be ported to Not Quite Perl (NQP),
the same language that Rakudo is written in, and this would be the
most effective way to run Muldis D Plain Text on all the backends/VMs that
Not Quite Perl supports, including Parrot, the JVM, and MoarVM.  As NQP is
specifically designed for writing other languages in, this would let Muldis
D operate closer to the metal than an implementation over Perl or another
typical high-level language would, while at the same time still saving a
lot of the work that would be involved in writing it in C.  In any event,
as the Muldis D Reference Engine is largely bootstrapped, most of it being
written in Muldis D itself, each port involves relatively little manual
translation to just get it working.

=item B<Muldis D Reference Engine for Other Languages>

The Muldis D Reference Engine would also be ported to a variety of other
general purpose languages, giving them the same benefits that Perl
programs have, and making Muldis D more universal.

=head1 FURTHER DOCUMENTATION

Please see the separately distributed L<Muldis::D::Manual> distribution for
Pod files with a potentially large collection of examples, tutorials, FAQs,
and so on that help people learn how to employ Muldis D and its
implementations for the things they need to do.  In particular, there
should be a lot of help given for people migrating from other systems that
use different paradigms than Muldis D does, for example SQL-using systems.

=head1 INFORMATION SOURCES

While making the Muldis D language, the following resources were found to
be particularly useful:

=over

=item L<http://www.thethirdmanifesto.com/>

This is the Hugh Darwen's and Chris Date (C.J. Date)'s home on the web for
"I<The Third Manifesto>" (I<TTM>), their formal proposal for a solid
foundation for data and database management systems (DBMSs); like Edgar
Codd (E.F. Codd)'s original papers, I<TTM> can be seen as an abstract
blueprint for the design of a DBMS and the language interface to such a
DBMS.  It consists in essence of a rigorous set of principles, stated in
the form of a series of prescriptions and proscriptions, that the authors
require adherence to on the part of a hypothetical database programming
language that they call B<D>.

The proposal would avoid 'Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch' between
object-oriented programming languages and RDBMSs by fully supporting all
the capabilities of the relational model.  The main objective of The Third
Manifesto, besides being theoretically sound and avoiding arbitrary
restrictions and pragmatic debasement of the relational model, is to make a
simple, restricted and precise definition of the role of object orientation
in database management systems emphasizing the few valid ideas from object
modeling that are orthogonal to relational modeling.

Muldis D has officially incorporated this blueprint into its own design,
and implements its principles without compromise, and so it is a concrete
language that qualifies as a B<D>.  The I<TTM> web site contains various
useful documents and links on the subject, some being specified further
below.

=item B<Databases, Types, and The Relational Model: The Third Manifesto>

Chris Date (C.J. Date), Hugh Darwen - "I<Databases, Types, and The
Relational Model: The Third Manifesto>, 3rd edition, Addison-Wesley, 2006
(ISBN: 0-321-39942-0)"; see
L<http://www.aw-bc.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0321399420,00.html>.

This is the thicker, college level textbook about I<The Third Manifesto>,
and it is the most central of the authors' publications, able to stand
alone and present nearly everything important.  It includes an informal
overview of both the relational model and a theory of types, a reference
section with the 15-page Manifesto proper and a grammar for a teaching
language
based on its principles called B<Tutorial D>, a larger section which
explains and rationalizes the parts of the Manifesto, and sections that do
likewise for type inheritance what the earlier sections do with the
Manifesto proper.

=item B<Database Explorations: Essays on The Third Manifesto and Related
Topics>

Chris Date (C.J. Date), Hugh Darwen - "I<Database Explorations: Essays on
The Third Manifesto and Related Topics>, 1st edition, Trafford, 2010 July
(ISBN: 9781426937231)"; see
L<http://bookstore.trafford.com/Products/SKU-000177853/Database-Explorations.aspx>.

This book is a followup to the prior-mentioned 2006 one and contains both
an updated version of the I<Manifesto> itself and also a collection of both
new and updated writings by the authors that are related.

Of particular interest for Muldis D, I<Database Explorations> cites by name
the DBMS prototype Muldis Rosetta, and its user language Muldis D, and
their author Darren Duncan; chapter 26, "An Approach Using Relation Valued
Attributes", is all about discussing Muldis D's canonical means to
represent missing information, which is with empty RVAs.  This is the very
first time that Muldis D or its author or related projects have ever been
recognized in an actual printed-on-paper book.

Note that the web site for I<The Third Manifesto>, mentioned above, has
reproduced several chapters and appendices from this book.  Chapter 1
(L<http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~hugh/TTM/DBE-Chapter01.pdf>) is the
15-page Manifesto proper; chapter 19
(L<http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~hugh/TTM/DBE-Chapter19.pdf>) is the 9-page
"Inheritance Model" which extends the former.  Chapter 11
(L<http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~hugh/TTM/DBE-Chapter11.pdf>) gives the
complete grammar of "B<Tutorial D>".

=item B<Database in Depth: Relational Theory for Practitioners>

Chris Date (C.J. Date) - "Database in Depth: Relational Theory for
Practitioners, 1st edition, Oreilly, 2005 (ISBN: 0-596-10012-4)"; see
L<http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/databaseid/>.

This is the first printed book that Muldis D's author had read fully, which
is related to I<The Third Manifesto>, and it was their main introduction.
It explains in an easy to follow matter just what the relational data model
really is, a solid and provable logical system, and partially contrasts
with SQL's distorted view of it.  While being easy to follow, the book is
written towards people that are already database professionals, and doesn't
go into the basics that we should already know.

=head1 SOME FULLY TTM/D RELATED DBMS PROJECTS

Besides the Muldis::D::Ref_Eng framework, other projects exist which attempt
to implement I<The Third Manifesto> fully and without compromise (that lack
anti-I<TTM> features), though their current implementations may be
incomplete and/or in development.  None of these use 'SQL' as their native
language.

I<This project list is out of date and some related projects are missing.>

=head2 Free and Open Source Software

These software projects are released under a free and open source license,
as Muldis::D::Ref_Eng is, so you have the freedom to use the software for any
purpose, to examine the project source code, change it, and redistribute
it:

=item B<FlipDB> - L<http://www.flipdb.com/>

FlipDB is a relational database management system written by Paul Mansour
(C<paul@carlislegroup.com>).  Pending a full implementation of the
relational algebra, FlipDB uses a simple but powerful query technique that
simulates relation-valued attributes and obviates the need for outer join
(or any explicit join).  The author is using Date's and Darwen's work as a
guide, and his intention is to not violate any of the principles set forth
in I<TTM>, if not to implement all of B<Tutorial D>.  It is written in
Dyalog APL, in a functional style with no loops or control structures, and
runs only on 32-bit Windows operating systems.  It is available under a
shared source agreement for personal use and study.
