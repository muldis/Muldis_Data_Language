    * Muldis::D version 0.126.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.126.0.tar.gz.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Completed
    the change item begun in release 0.125.0 concerning basic
    stimulus-response rules support.  In both Perl-STD, added the new pod
    sub-section "Stimulus-Response Rule Specification" under "MATERIAL
    SPECIFICATION".  In PTMD_STD.pod, added the missing/TODO paragraph in
    that same sub-section.  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the
    "StimRespRule" catalog type description to indicate its default value.

2010-05-05  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.125.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.125.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features computational and Turing completeness; the
    Muldis D language spec is now complete enough, both in system-catalog
    and concrete grammars, that Muldis D can simulate any computer.  Muldis
    D code can now be a "main program" (run automatically at system
    startup), can do user I/O, can read from and write to memory, can
    contain conditionals, can contain repetition, can calculate any values
    from single or multiple other values, and all this using only syntax
    and features that are described in the current written spec.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, STDIO.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod, Temporal.pod)
    In PTMD_STD.pod, updated the "Procedure Specification" pod sub-section
    so that a procedure body now has a pair of square brackets delimiting
    it rather than a pair of curly braces.  This further instills the
    visual mnemonic that square brackets means that the relative order of
    the elements inside them is significant, while the relative order of
    elements in curly braces is not significant; as it is true for array
    elements vs sets etc, it is true for proceure statements vs atomic
    routines etc.  As part of this update, split the grammar node
    "empty_routine_body" into the 2 "empty_[atomic|procedure]_body".  In
    the other 4 files, updated all 10 system-service routine signatures to
    use "[...]" to represent the routine body rather than "{...}".

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Removed the procedure "sys.std.Core.Cat.noop"
    since, for any purpose it might have been used, better options exist.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the "Procedure" catalog type to make it
    more strict in that the root node of its "stmt" statement tree must
    always be a compound statement node, not any other kind of stmt node.
    As it is, the root would be a compound likely 99% of the time in real
    procedures, and this restriction lets the concrete grammars be simpler.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Formalized the syntax for
    compound statements in procedures, where each such statement is a
    sequence of other statements that execute in order at different times,
    which is the heart of what makes a procedure nonatomic.  Added the new
    pod sub-section "Generic Compound Statements" in the main pod section
    "GENERIC PROCEDURE STATEMENTS", including a code example.  In PTMD_STD,
    this section introduced the main node kind "compound_stmt".  In all 3
    files, updated the sub-section "Procedure Specification" such that a
    nonempty procedure body may now have zero explicit statements rather
    than requiring one, because the body now implicitly always has a
    compound statement as its root statement.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added new special shorthand
    syntax for inlining an updater definition plus an invocation of said in
    a procedure statement, as a concept called a "procedure atomic
    statement".  Added th new pod sub-section "Procedure Atomic Statements"
    in the main pod section "GENERIC PROCEDURE STATEMENTS", including a
    code example.  In PTMD_STD, this section introduced the main node kind
    "atomic_stmt", which looks similar to a "compound_stmt" but for having
    curly brace delimiters rather than square brackets, and for appearing
    as an updater body than as a procedure body.  In all 3 files, updated
    code example in the sub-section "Procedure Specification" to make use
    of the new shorthand syntax for its inner updater rather than a "with".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  In a reversal of one aspect of release 0.29.0,
    brought back and added a description for the "Exception" catalog type,
    which is currently a singleton scalar type which can say that an
    exception occurred but not any other metadata such as the kind of
    exception.  The type was added in the new main pod section "TYPES FOR
    DEFINING EXCEPTIONS".  Rewriting "Exception" to carry metadata is still
    TODO, but in the meantime Muldis D code can at least throw and catch
    exceptions and so use them for good program design.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Updated the "sys.std.Core.Cat.fail" procedure
    to make its "Exception"-typed parameter optional; it will now throw the
    default "Exception" value if the user doesn't supply some other one.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Formalized the syntax for
    try-catch exception handling in procedures, which takes the form of a
    pair of imperative routines where the first is executed unconditionally
    and the second optional one iff the first throws an exception, where
    the first exception is caught but the second isn't.  Added the new pod
    sub-section "Generic Try-Catch Statements" in the main pod section
    "GENERIC PROCEDURE STATEMENTS", including a code example.  In PTMD_STD,
    this section introduced the main node kind "try_catch_stmt".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Formalized the syntax for
    conditional statements in procedures, both the if-then-else and
    given-when-then-default varieties.  Added the 2 new pod sub-sections
    "Generic [If-Else|Given-When-Default] Statements" in the main pod
    section "GENERIC PROCEDURE STATEMENTS", including a code example for
    each.  In PTMD_STD, these sections introduced the 2 main node kinds
    "if_else_stmt" and "given_when_def_stmt".  These additions are just
    like the similar-named functional analogies, but for being imperative.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the "LoopStmtNodeSet" catalog type to
    rename its "do" attribute to "loop".  Also updated the descriptions of
    the 2 catalog types "[Leave|Iterate]StmtNodeSet", to remove a comment
    about the first being able to "leave" itself, and to add a comment
    about the second also being able to serve as a non-loop "redo" stmt.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Formalized the syntax for
    iteration statements in procedures, specifically in the ad-hoc manner
    of the 3 distinct "leave", "iterate", "loop" statement kinds.  Added
    the new pod sub-section "Procedure Leave, Iterate, and Loop Statements"
    in the main pod section "GENERIC PROCEDURE STATEMENTS", including a
    single code example for each file that combines the 3 node kinds (all
    are also useable in isolation).  In PTMD_STD, these sections introduced
    the 3 main node kinds "leave_stmt", "iterate_stmt", "loop_stmt".

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the "TYPE SYSTEM" main pod section to add a
    couple paragraphs saying that one might say Muldis D uses "progressive
    nominal typing" (thanks Larry Wall for coming up with that term)
    with respect to values declaring their types but the associated type
    constraints only apply if the types are defined, and that users never
    have to define any data types as practically all Muldis D features are
    enabled just through their ability to define routines, and so data
    types mainly serve to provide constraints, say what users may *not* do.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  Added language support
    for basic stimulus-response rules, namely just the variety that invokes
    a routine in response to a depot mounting, which supports the bootstrap
    of a pure Muldis D call chain.  In Basics.pod, added new main pod
    section "STIMULUS-RESPONSE RULES" to introduce this feature.  In
    Types_Catalog.pod, added the 2 new catalog types "StimRespRuleSet" and
    "StimRespRule", the latter in the new main pod section "TYPES FOR
    DEFINING STIMULUS-RESPONSE RULES", and updated the "Depot" type to add
    a 14th attribute "stim_resp_rules".  In PTMD_STD.pod, added new
    material node kind "stim_resp_rule" and fully described its grammar
    (save for a missing paragraph, TODO) plus an example, this in the new
    pod sub-section "Stimulus-Response Rule Specification" under "MATERIAL
    SPECIFICATION".  Still TODO is add the corresponding sub-section in the
    2 Perl-STD dialect files.

2010-05-01  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.124.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.124.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features something that has been a long time in coming,
    which is the addition of concrete syntax in all 3 Muldis D dialects for
    specifying the scaffolding and interfaces/signatures of all 4 main
    kinds of routines, as well as the concrete syntax for inlining a
    material inside a routine ("with" clause).  And so now the Muldis D
    spec is complete with regard to how to specify all parts of atomic
    routines (functions, updaters, recipes), meaning how to specify the
    vast majority of database query and data manipulation code.  This
    release also adds to the specs of how to write nonatomic procedure
    bodies, including lexical variable declarations and static value
    assignments, and adds the ability to inline static values for arguments
    to imperative routine invocations by procedures.  Following this
    release, which addresses the single largest remaining hole in the
    Muldis D spec, subsequent releases only have left to address
    progressively smaller holes.  The first next release should add
    concrete syntax for defining data types, meaning the vast majority of
    database data definition code.  After that would come things like
    conditionals and loops in procedures, more kinds of constraints, more
    on procedure exception handling, more on stimulus-response-rules, etc.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the "Material Reference Selector Expressions"
    pod sub-section to clarify that a "material_ref" (and "curried_func")
    node (in all 3 dialects) can take any primary namespace qualified name
    chain as its "material_name" and will do the right thing; so when
    you're starting with an "AbsPathMaterialNC" then the "material_ref"
    will silently replace with a name-chain literal; this is particularly
    useful so that any system-defined type or routine name "foo" that will
    be used as a routine argument can just be written "<foo>" rather than
    having to be "PNSQNameChain:foo".

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Restricted a procedure so that it
    can now only invoke a niladic function directly, and so invoking a
    function with any parameters requires an updater or recipe
    intermediary.  In Basics.pod, updated 2 sentences in "Functions,
    Updaters, Recipes, and Procedures" about this matter.  In
    Types_Catalog.pod, renamed the catalog type "FuncInvoStmtNodeSet" to
    add the name-prefix "Nil", removed its "args" 5th attribute, and
    updated its description.  Also updated the "StmtNodeSet" catalog type
    to rename its "func_invo_stmts" attribute adding th name-prefix "nil_".

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  In Basics.pod, updated the "Kinds of
    Procedures" pod sub-section to add new routine kind "transaction" which
    is a "procedure" that is its own lexical-scope-bound transaction but
    isn't a "system-service".  In Types_Catalog.pod, added corresponding
    catalog type "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.Transaction", which is a proper
    subtype of "Procedure".

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Fixed a fossil from release 0.123.0 where a
    grammar detail in PTMD_STD was changed but the corresponding detail in
    the 2 Perl dialects was not; the "depot_catalog_payload" node now
    composes "named_material" rather than "material".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In the "Scalar Selectors"
    pod sub-section, updated a couple code examples to use abbrev versions
    of sys-def type names, to reflect more typical real-life usage.

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated all code examples showing a
    "function" node so that they reflect changes in the planned spec for
    routine-specifying "material" nodes.  The old plan grouped all the
    details of a routine sans its name into a "payload" third (or second)
    element of a "material" node, and for the "function" examples these
    "payload" were arrays with the 3 elements: result type, parameters,
    function body.  The new plan groups all the payload elements except the
    function body into a single function heading element, so that a payload
    for a routine now always has exactly 2 elements.  In HDMD_Perl6_STD,
    the new "payload" is now a Perl "Pair" value, while in HDMD_Perl5_STD,
    the new "payload" is expressed as a 2-element array ref that represents
    a Pair without actually being one, same as some other 2-e in Perl5_STD.

    * (HDMD_Perl5_STD.pod)  In the "DEPOT SPECIFICATION" main pod section,
    updated the second and third elements of a "depot" node
    ("depot-catalog" and "depot-data") so that each is now a 2-element Perl
    array ref rather than a 1-element Perl hash ref; but the conception of
    these hasn't changed, and is still intended to represent a Perl 6
    "Pair" value (as HTMD_Perl6_STD still has) without actually being one. 
    Also updated any relevant code examples in that section plus in the
    "CATALOG ABSTRACTION LEVELS" section.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Formalized the syntax for
    static value expressions and assignments in procedures.  Now it is
    defined how to use a scalar literal or niladic function call directly
    as a routine invocation read-only argument in a procedure, such that
    corresponding lexical variables are automatically generated by the
    parser (just variable names are allowed for subject-to-update arguments
    as before).  It is also defined now that the "iproc_imp_invo" grammar
    node now is used to define tuples of 4 different "StmtNodeSet"
    attributes; not just "ImpInvoStmtNodeSet" as before, but also
    "[OVLScaVal|APMaterialNCSel|NilFuncInvo]StmtNodeSet"; the latter 3 are
    used often when the node is invoking "assign"; it falls from this that
    ":=" syntax also works for all 3 when appropriate.  Added the new pod
    sub-section "Procedure Value Expressions" in the main pod section
    "GENERIC PROCEDURE STATEMENTS"; also substantially updated the
    sub-sections "Generic In-Procedure Imperative Invocation Statements"
    and "Imperative Simple Non-symmetric Dyadic Infix Operators".  In
    PTMD_STD, these sections introduced 2 new main node kinds "proc_expr",
    "var_name", "nil_func_invo", and "proc_stmt__plain_rtn_inv" was smplfd.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Rearranged the grammar elements a small amount,
    specifically be consolidating these 5 grammar nodes into the
    otherwise-still-empty "Recipe Specification" pod sub-section:
    "upd_cosigil" (from "Generic In-Multi-Update-Statement Imperative
    Invocation Statements"), "lex_entity_name"+"data_sigil",
    "infix_bind_op" (all 3 from "GENERIC VALUE EXPRESSIONS"),
    "routine_name" (from "Generic Function Invocation Expressions").

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  As the single most-important
    then-remaining Muldis D spec update to do, in all 3 STD.pod, completely
    populated the 4 pod sub-sections "[Function|Updater|Recipe|Procedure]
    Specification", thereby providing the complete grammar for all 4 main
    routine kinds that had otherwise been missing, except for some portions
    of a procedure body, which wouldn't have been in those sections anyway.
    For all 4 main routine kinds, these additions supplied a complete
    grammar for the scaffholding and public interfaces of those routines,
    as well as how to embed other materials in them.  As applicable,
    specified how to declare read-only or subject-to-update parameters, and
    regular or global parameters, and optional parameters, and dispatch
    parameters (which declare the routine as virtual), declarations of
    implementing other routines, declarations of lexical variables.
    Specified routine bodies' lexical variables or procedural statements or
    named expressions.  Explained how the grammar mapped to the various
    catalog types "Function", "Updater", "Recipe", "Procedure", etc.  Each
    of the 4 routine kinds has a complete code example for specifying a
    complete routine of that type, in all 3 grammars; also demonstrated was
    how to embed routines, how to perform recursion, how to run a query on
    the database, how to output a message to the user.  In PTMD_STD, these
    sections introduced these new 29 main node kinds:
    "[function|updater|recipe|procedure][|_[payload|heading|body]]",
    "result_type", "[upd|ro]_[reg|global]_param", "param_name",
    "[opt|dispatch]_param_flag", "global_var_name", "implements_clause",
    "with_clause", "empty_routine_body", "proc_var".

2010-04-27  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.123.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.123.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features the addition of concrete syntax in all 3 Muldis
    D dialects for writing statements of imperative routines, particularly
    ones for invoking imperative routines; both generic invocation syntax
    for any imperative plus special alternate syntax for 11 imperatives
    including the generic variable assignment operator ":=" are included.
    This complements the long-existing concrete syntax for invoking
    functions and writing value expressions.  And so now the vast majority
    of what one would normally write within a routine body is now specced.
    The most important related thing still not specced is declaring the
    scaffolding and interfaces/signatures of routines, as well as inlining
    a routine inside a routine ("with" clause), and those are expected to
    be delivered in the very next release.  Also still not specced and not
    to be delivered until later on include most kinds of statements one
    would only find in a procedure that aren't routine invocations, such as
    imperative conditionals and loops, especially loops.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  For each of the 4 catalog types "Function",
    "Updater", "Recipe", "Procedure" updated the description with its
    "dispatch_params" attribute to clarify that any given routine parameter
    can not be both a dispatch parameter and an optional parameter.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In the "plain_rtn_inv" pod
    sub-section, corrected a mistaken omission by adding "MATERIAL
    SPECIFICATION" to the list of main pod sections whose grammar
    constructs code at the "plain_rtn_inv" abstraction level may employ.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the "Material Specification Common Elements"
    pod sub-section to add "transaction" as an option (subservient to
    "procedure" like "system-service") to the "material_kind" grammar node.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Multiple small grammar updates or refactors.  Split
    the "func_arg_list" grammar node into itself plus "func_arg", and
    "expr_name" into itself plus "lex_entity_name".  Renamed the
    "param_name" node to "invo_param_name".  The "depot_catalog_payload"
    node now composes a "named_material" rather than a "material".  The
    "expr_core_options" node has been merged into the "expr__plain_rtn_inv"
    node, and "expr__rtn_inv_alt_syn" now composes the latter rather than
    the former.  The "catalog__plain_rtn_inv" node now composes
    "catalog__code_as_data" rather than "Database", which is composed by
    its replacement anyway.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Basics.pod)  In all 3 STD.pod,
    added the 2 new main pod sections "GENERIC [UPDATER OR
    RECIPE|PROCEDURE] STATEMENTS", which have the same role as "GENERIC
    VALUE EXPRESSIONS" but that they describe the generic imperative
    statement syntaxes rather than the generic value expression syntaxes;
    the 2 new sections initially have no pod sub-sections.  In PTMD_STD,
    these sections introduced these new 4 main node kinds: "update_stmt",
    "proc_stmt", "stmt_name", "named_stmt"; they also include example code
    for the last 2 of those 4.  In all 3 STD.pod, in the "plain_rtn_inv"
    pod sub-section, added the 2 new main pod sections to the list of those
    whose grammar constructs code at the "plain_rtn_inv" abstraction level
    may employ.  In Basics.pod, updated the main pod section "NOTES ON TEXT
    CHARACTER LITERALS" concerning the "|" char, which is now the sigil for
    statement node names as seen in "stmt_name", "named_stmt".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added the 2 new pod
    sub-sections "Generic In-[Multi-Update-Statement|Procedure] Imperative
    Invocation Statements", one each respectively in the 2 main pod
    sections "GENERIC [UPDATER OR RECIPE|PROCEDURE] STATEMENTS"; these have
    the same role as "Generic Function Invocation Expressions" but that
    they are for invoking imperative routines rather than functions.  In
    PTMD_STD, these sections introduced these new 2 main node kinds:
    "imus_imp_invo", "iproc_imp_invo"; they both also include example code.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added the new main pod
    section "IMPERATIVE INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX STATEMENTS", which has
    the same role as "FUNCTION INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS" but
    that it describes special syntaxes for invocations of imperative
    routines rather than of functions; the 2 new sections initially have no
    pod sub-sections.  In the "rtn_inv_alt_syn" pod sub-section, added the
    new main pod section to the list of those whose grammar constructs code
    at the "rtn_inv_alt_syn" abstraction level may employ.  In PTMD_STD,
    the new section introduced the new main node kind
    "imp_invo_alt_syntax".  In PTMD_STD.pod, also split each of the 2
    grammar nodes "update_stmt", "proc_stmt" 3 ways, into itself plus
    otherwise-same-named variants suffixed with "__plain_rtn_inv" or
    "__rtn_inv_alt_syn", and tied those triples to the current catalog
    abstraction level, such that the "__plain_rtn_inv" variant was the same
    as the pre-split node, and the "__rtn_inv_alt_syn" variant adds to that
    the "imp_invo_alt_syntax" grammar options.

    * (Ordered.pod, Integer.pod, Boolean.pod)  In Ordered.pod, added the
    new main pod section "VIRTUAL UPDATERS FOR THE ORDINAL MIXIN TYPE"
    which includes the 2 new virtual updaters
    "sys.std.Core.Ordered.Ordinal.assign_[pred|succ]".  In each of
    Integer.pod and Boolean.pod, added the new main pod section "UPDATERS
    IMPLEMENTING VIRTUAL ORDINAL FUNCTIONS" which includes 2 new updaters
    which implement the 2 virtuals and have the same unqualified names.
    These new updaters provide the exact same functionality as the "--" and
    "++" monadic operators common to programming languages which decrement
    or increment a var; Muldis D's existing "pred|succ" weren't mutators.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within the main pod section
    "IMPERATIVE INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX STATEMENTS", added the 2 new
    pod sub-sections "Imperative Simple [Monadic Postfix|Non-symmetric
    Dyadic Infix] Operators".  The additions provide concrete syntaxes
    specific to these 11 updaters: 2 "Ordinal.assign_[succ|pred]" as
    ":=++",":=--", 1 "Universal.assign" as ":=", 8 "Relation.assign_\w+";
    the unique parts of the latter 8's names being: "union", "restriction",
    "cmpl_restr", "intersection", "diff", "semidiff", "semijoin",
    "exclusion".  In PTMD_STD, the 2 new sub-sections introduced the 2 new
    main node kinds "imp_[monadic_postfix|nonsym_dyadic_infix]_op_invo";
    both new sections included example code.

    * (Relation.pod, Universal.pod, Ordered.pod)  Added also-known-as notes
    for 11 assign/assign-shorthand updaters in correspondence to previous
    change item.

2010-04-25  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.122.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.122.0.tar.gz.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Added the 2 functions
    "sys.std.Core.Cat.curried_func_[invo|static_exten]" which make it
    easier to work with higher-order functions.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, Relation.pod)  In PTMD_STD.pod,
    updated the "Simple Non-symmetric Dyadic Infix Operators" pod
    sub-section to add special infix-op syntax for 3 functions; the new ops
    "assuming","where","[!|not-]where" map respectively to
    "curried_func_static_exten", "Relation.[restriction|cmpl_restr]".  In
    the other 2 files, updated the also-known-as notes for th same 3 funcs.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Basics.pod)  A change that was
    a long time in coming.  In all 3 STD.pod, rewrote the pod sub-section
    "Library Entity Reference Selector", in the process renaming it to
    "Material Reference Selector Expressions", and renaming the node
    "lib_entity_ref_selector" to "material_ref_sel_expr".  Merged the 5
    PTMD_STD node formats "[F|U|P|T|ODF]->foo" to the one "<foo>", since
    behind the scenes they all would turn into the same thing anyway as of
    release 0.79.0; also, the two Perl-STD formats now use the one
    "['material-ref','foo']" rather than the 5
    "['[func|upd|proc|type|ord-det-func]-ref','foo']"; this common format
    is the "material_ref" node kind.  Also in that pod sub-section added
    the new node kind "curried_func", an example of which looks like
    "<foo>( bar => $baz )" or "['curried-func','foo',{bar=>['$','baz']}]";
    this essentially is a "material_ref" which is then curried with some
    bound arguments; the latter is the typical form of higher-order
    functions.  Also brought any code examples up to date that had used the
    old "->" formats.  In Basics.pod, updated the main pod section "NOTES
    ON TEXT CHARACTER LITERALS" concerning the "<>" chars and others.

    * Muldis::D version 0.121.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.121.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features the purge of all temporal concerning features
    except for the temporal mixin types and virtual routines; all non-mixin
    temporal types, all non-virtual temporal routines, and the temporal
    standard syntax extension in all 3 concrete grammars were removed.  But
    not lost; these removed bits will soon be put in a file in the
    Muldis::D::Manual distribution, ostensibly in case someone wants to
    derive from them a user-defined extension or something.  The primary
    reason for this move is that details of the Gregorian calendar et al
    are too complicated and too subject to change to define in a core
    programming language spec, and are best left to separate modules; and
    even if not, the existing TAI/UTC types needed a huge refactor anyway.
    As a result of this purge, the spec was made smaller by 53K of text in
    its lib/ dir, which is 5% of its release-0.120.0 lib/ size.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Updated the 2 mixin types "Instant","Duration" so
    that their default values are now implementation-defined.  This also
    affects the type of "Instant.fetch_curr_instant" when its "target"
    argument has the declared type of "Instant"; the fetched datetime would
    have the same type as the implementation-defined default value.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the "OVLScalar" catalog type to remove
    the 5 values "[TAI|UTC|Float]Instant", "[TAI|UTC]Duration".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In all 3 STD.pod, completely
    removed the "temporal" standard syntax extension, which provided
    special value literal syntax to all the system-defined non-mixin
    temporal types.  Removed the whole main pod section "TEMPORAL EXTENSION
    OPAQUE VALUE LITERALS", which had a sub-section "Date and Time
    Literals", and declared the 5 value node kinds
    "[TAI|UTC|Float]Instant", "[TAI|UTC]Duration".  Also updated the main
    pod section "STANDARD SYNTAX EXTENSIONS" to first remove the pod
    sub-section "temporal" and then to say that there are currently zero
    standard syntax extensions; also updated the "LANGUAGE NAME" main pod
    section to say likewise on the latter.  Also updated a "Scalar" code
    example to make "UTCDateTime" into a user-defined type.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Removed most of the DESCRIPTION and TYPE SUMMARY main
    pod sections, leaving shorter versions.  Removed these 6 entire main
    pod sections: "DATA TYPES FOR TEMPORAL ARTIFACTS", "FUNCTIONS
    IMPLEMENTING VIRTUAL [ORDERED|INSTANT|DURATION] FUNCTIONS", "FUNCTIONS
    FOR CONVERSION BETWEEN UTC AND TAI", "SYSTEM-SERVICES IMPLEMENTING
    VIRTUALS FOR CURRENT DATES AND TIMES".  With those sections, these 16
    non-mixin types were removed: "PInt[12|31]", "NNInt[23|59]",
    "NNRatLT62", "TAI[Instant|Duration]",
    "[UTC|Float][Instant|DateTime|Date|Time]", "UTCDuration"; also, these
    27 non-virtual functions were removed: 15
    "[TAI|UTC|Float]Instant.[order|[|abs_]diff|[lat|earli]er]", 10
    "[TAI|UTC]Duration.[order|abs|sum|[|abs_]diff]", 2
    "UTCInstant.[UTC_from_TAI|TAI_from_UTC]"; also, these 7 non-virtual
    system-service routines were removed: TAIInstant.fetch_curr_instant",
    "[UTC|Float]Instant.fetch_curr_[datetime|date|time]".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the "Material Specification Common Elements"
    pod sub-section to add "database-type" as an option (subservient to
    "tuple-type") to the "material_kind" grammar node.

2010-04-23  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.120.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.120.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features the addition of the 2 system-defined mixin
    types "Instant" and "Duration", and so now users can do common temporal
    concerning things in a completely calendar-agnostic manner, and the
    temporal-concerning parts of the language are now less kludgy.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Added the 2 new mixin types
    "sys.std.Temporal.Type.[Instant|Duration]" in a new main pod section
    "TEMPORAL MIXIN DATA TYPES".  Also updated the descriptions of the 3
    scalar types "[TAI|UTC|Float]Instant" so that they directly compose
    "Instant", and the 2 scalar types "[TAI|UTC]Duration" so that they
    directly compose "Duration".  Also updated "TYPE SUMMARY".

    * (Temporal.pod)  Added the 2 new main pod sections VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS
    FOR THE [INSTANT|DURATION] MIXIN TYPE, which include 4 new virtual
    functions each, which are
    "sys.std.Temporal.Instant.[[|abs_]diff|[lat|earli]er]" and
    "sys.std.Temporal.Duration.[abs|sum|[|abs_]diff]", respectively.  Also
    split the main pod section "FUNCTIONS FOR TEMPORAL MATH" into the 2
    "FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTING VIRTUAL [INSTANT|DURATION] FUNCTIONS", which
    got 12 and 8 of its functions, respectively; for each of those 20
    functions, updated that function so that it implements the new function
    with the same partially-qualified name.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Added new main pod section "VIRTUAL SYSTEM-SERVICES
    FOR CURRENT DATES AND TIMES" which includes 1 new virtual
    system-service routine "sys.std.Temporal.Instant.fetch_curr_instant".
    Also renamed the main pod section "SYSTEM-SERVICES FOR CURRENT DATES
    AND TIMES" to "SYSTEM-SERVICES IMPLEMENTING VIRTUALS FOR CURRENT DATES
    AND TIMES" and updated each of its 7 system-services so that it
    implements the new system-service.

    * (Core.pod, README)  Updated recommended reading order of core files.

    * (Relation.pod)  Updated the 2 functions "rank[|_by_attr_names]" to
    add a "first_rank" parameter, letting you customize at which starting
    number the generated rank numbers begin; this should help with using
    "rank" as a generator of non-descriptive id attributes for a set of
    records to insert where the ids don't conflict with existing-used ones.

    * Muldis::D version 0.119.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.119.0.tar.gz.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  In a reversal of one aspect of release
    0.117.0, split the 1 "imp_invo" routine into the 3
    "[upd|rcp|proc]_invo"; because this language feature takes the form of
    an ordinary routine, it must follow ordinary routine rules, which
    include that updaters can't invoke recipes or procedures, etc, and so
    each of the 3 imperative routine kinds needs its own "_invo".

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Made "fail" into a procedure rather than a
    recipe; it isn't a valid recipe because it never updates a variable;
    also it can only reasonably be invoked by a procedure anyway.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the catalog type "Recipe" to rename its
    2 "[upd|ro]_globals" attributes to "[upd|ro]_global_params"; also moved
    those upwards in the attribute list to just follow "opt_params".

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Updated all 25 of the system-defined recipes
    which would directly access global variables as implicit parameters so
    that the recipes' signatures explicitly declare which globals they
    access, resembling a normal param declaration.  This corresponds to
    planned PTMD_STD additions which would formalize that recipe
    declarations must have said globals decls.  This change has no impact
    on how one would invoke a recipe.  Each updated recipe declared 1 or 2
    global-params, which are 1 or 2 each of "&$mounts ::= $mnt.cat.mounts",
    "&$cat ::= $fed.cat", "&$data ::= $fed.data".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the descriptions of the 4 catalog types
    "Function","Updater","Recipe","Procedure" to clarify that a routine
    body must not be specified if that routine is virtual.

    * (Universal.pod, Scalar.pod, Boolean.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod,
    Blob.pod, Text.pod, Cast.pod, Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod,
    Array.pod, Bag.pod, Interval.pod, STDIO.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod,
    Ordered.pod, Numeric.pod, Stringy.pod, Counted.pod, Temporal.pod)
    Reformatted all system-defined routine declarations to match the
    planned new PTMD_STD format for declaring "stub" routines that lack
    routine bodies, which is to simply have "..." as the entire routine
    body.  This is inspired by Perl 6, whose "yadayadayada" operator
    spelled "..." will compile as valid code but throw an exception if
    executed, saying the likes of "this routine isn't implemented", so
    reading it means exactly the same thing to programmers and to the
    computer, that something is missing. In Muldis D, writing for example
    "updater foo (&$bar@ : Numeric) {...}" will compile as valid code,
    represented in the system catalog as a virtual updater with no body.
    In general many system-defined routines would be implementation-defined
    and have no body defined in Muldis D, but for the sake of brevity all
    of the documented signatures will declare no body in pretend.

2010-04-17  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.118.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.118.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features the addition of the 2 system-defined mixin
    types "Numeric" and "Stringy"; the former would be composed by types
    like "Int" and "Rat", while the latter would be composed by types like
    "Blob" and "Text".  Related to this, the concrete grammars concerning
    math and string ops have been consolidated and greatly improved.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  In the "DBMS Entity Name Literals" pod sub-section,
    updated the paragraph about the first special case of "PNSQNameChain"
    supporting abbreviated chains, to say that if there are multiple
    in-core routines with the same unqualified name, then that unqualified
    name may be used for a routine invocation iff exactly 1 of the
    candidates is a virtual routine and the other candidates implement it;
    the invocation would then resolve to the virtual routine.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the "NESTING PRECEDENCE RULES" main pod
    section to give bullet-headings to the 7 precedence levels: "Terms",
    "P[ost|re]fix", "[Dyadic|Reducing] Infix", "Conditional", "Naming".

    * (Integer.pod, Rational.pod, Ordered.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod,
    Array.pod, Bag.pod, Counted.pod)  Removed all 14 "maybe_" variants of
    built-in functions in order to simplify the language.  Between
    Integer.pod and Rational.pod, 6 functions that would fail due to a
    division by zero had counterparts that wrapped the normal result in a
    Maybe and resulted in nothing when said failure would otherwise occur:
    "[Integer|Rational].maybe_[quotient|mean]",
    "Integer.maybe_[remainder|quot_and_rem]"; instead of using those, users
    can just invoke the normal versions conditionally based on an easily
    testable input.  In Ordered.pod, 3 N-ary functions that would result in
    special infinity values as identities if they have zero inputs have
    counterparts that wrapped the normal result: "maybe_[min|max|minmax]";
    users should use the normal versions and either conditionally invoke
    them or conditionally test the results.  In each of the other 5 pod
    files, there was a single generic reduction operator that took an
    explicit identity value argument, and a variant saved the need for that
    argument by resulting in a Maybe:
    "[Relation|Set|Array|Bag].maybe_reduction",
    "Counted.counted_maybe_reduction"; use the normal versions instead.

    * (Integer.pod, Rational.pod)  Corrected each of the 2 functions
    "sys.std.Core.[Integer|Rational].range" so that it now fails if given
    zero inputs rather than resulting in zero; while a range of zero is the
    correct answer for a single-element set, a zero-elem set has no range.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In all 3 STD.pod, renamed the
    "Rational Operators That Do Rounding" pod sub-section to substitute in
    "Numeric", and renamed all grammar nodes that it declared from
    containing "rat_op" to containing "num_op".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Integer.pod, Basics.pod)
    Regarding the "Integer.remainder" function, eliminated the alternate
    infix op syntax "%" and instead standardized on "mod" for that purpose.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod)
    Renamed the alternate syntaxes for all 5 math functions that do either
    division or exponentiation.  The spellings were changed as follows:
    "i/" -> "div", "r/" -> "/", "i^" -> "exp", "r^" -> "**", "e^" -> "e**".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the concrete grammars
    to reflect that the integer division and modulo operators have a
    mandatory "round_meth" 3rd parameter; this completes a spec change
    begun in release 0.113.0, where the function sigs gained the parameter.
    In all 3 STD.pod, moved "div" and "mod" from the "Simple Non-symmetric
    Dyadic Infix Operators" pod sub-section to "Numeric Operators That Do
    Rounding", with appropriate grammar and example code updates.

    * (Integer.pod, Rational.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod,
    Basics.pod)  In Integer.pod, renamed each of the 3 functions
    "quotient", "mean", "mean_of_median" to prepend "whole_".  In
    Rational.pod, renamed each of the same 3 functions to prepend "frac_".
    In all 6 files, updated any references to the renamed as appropriate.

    * (Integer.pod, Rational.pod)  Added 8 numeric functions and tweaked
    the descriptions of others so to bring the complement of integer and
    rational functions as much in sync with each other as is reasonably
    possible, and otherwise fill in some related functionality gaps.  In
    Integer.pod, added these 3 functions: "frac_quotient", "frac_mean",
    "frac_mean_of_median".  In Rational.pod, added these 3 functions:
    "whole_quotient", "remainder", "quot_and_rem".  In both files, added
    the 1 function "power_with_whole_exp".

    * (Types.pod)  In Types.pod, added new mixin type
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Numeric" in the main pod section "GENERIC MIXIN DATA
    TYPES".  Also updated the descriptions of the 2 scalar types
    "Int","Rat" so that they directly compose "Numeric".  Also updated the
    "TYPE SUMMARY".

    * Added new initially-empty file Core/Numeric.pod whose purpose is to
    consolidate the main virtual routines associated with the "Numeric"
    type.  Updated Core.pod and the README file to reflect the added file.

    * (Numeric.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod)  In Numeric.pod, added new
    main pod section "VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS FOR THE NUMERIC MIXIN TYPE" which
    includes 15 new virtual functions in the "sys.std.Core.Numeric.\w+"
    namespace: "abs", "sum", "[|abs_]diff", "product",
    "[frac|whole]_quotient", "remainder", "quot_and_rem", "range",
    "frac_mean", "median", "frac_mean_of_median", "mode",
    "power_with_whole_exp".  In each of Integer.pod and Rational.pod,
    updated each of the 15 functions with the same unqualified names so
    that it implements the same-named new function, and wrapped up the 15
    functions into the new main pod section "FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTING VIRTUAL
    NUMERIC FUNCTIONS".  Following these changes, in Integer.pod, the main
    pod section "FUNCTIONS FOR INTEGER MATH" now just has these 4
    functions: "whole_mean[|_of_median]", "power", "factorial"; in
    Rational.pod, the main pod section "FUNCTIONS FOR RATIONAL MATH" just
    has these 5 functions: "round", "[|natural_][power|log]".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Numeric.pod, Integer.pod,
    Rational.pod)  Reorganized all of the special alternate function
    syntaxes that had belonged to any of the 30 math functions that gained
    a virtual analogy, so that now only the latter have associated special
    syntaxes and the former now don't.  The following 5
    "Integer","Rational" pairs of syntaxes
    were consolidated into a single "Numeric" syntax each:
    "[i|r][+|*|-]" -> "[+|*|-]", "i|-|","r|-|" -> "|-|",
    "i||","r||" -> "||".  The 2 syntaxes "div","mod" were simply moved from
    "Integer" to "Numeric", and the 1 "/" from "Rational" to "Numeric".
    The 1 new syntax "^" was added initially in "Numeric", for the
    "power_with_whole_exp" function.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  In Types.pod, added new mixin type
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Stringy" in the main pod section "GENERIC MIXIN DATA
    TYPES".  Also updated the descriptions of the 2 scalar types
    "Blob","Text", and the 1 nonscalar type "Array", so that they directly
    compose "Stringy".  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the descriptions of
    the 4 scalar types "String","Name","NameChain","Comment" so that they
    directly compose "Stringy".  Also updated "TYPE SUMMARY" in both files.

    * Added new initially-empty file Core/Stringy.pod whose purpose is to
    consolidate the main virtual routines associated with the "Stringy"
    type.  Updated Core.pod and the README file to reflect the added file.

    * (Stringy.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod, Array.pod)  In Stringy.pod, added
    new main pod section "VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS FOR THE STRINGY MIXIN TYPE"
    which includes 2 new virtual functions in the
    "sys.std.Core.Stringy.\w+" namespace: "catenation", "replication".  In
    each of Blob.pod, Text.pod, and Array.pod, updated each of the 2
    functions with the same unqualified names so that it implements the
    same-named new function, and wrapped up the 2 functions into the new
    main pod section "FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTING VIRTUAL STRINGY FUNCTIONS".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Stringy.pod, Blob.pod,
    Text.pod, Array.pod)  Reorganized all of the special alternate function
    syntaxes that had belonged to any of the 6 stringy functions that
    gained a virtual analogy, so that now only the latter have associated
    special syntaxes and the former now don't.  The following 2
    "Blob","Text","Array" triples of syntaxes were consolidated into a
    single "Stringy" syntax each: "[b|t|a][~|-x]" -> "[~|x]".

2010-04-11  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.117.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.117.0.tar.gz.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Fixed 2 mistakes in the "OPERATOR CHARACTER
    REPERTOIRE" main pod section that release 0.116.0 introduced.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod)  Large simplification to
    the Muldis D abstract grammar / system catalog such that the process of
    invoking an imperative routine (updater, recipe, or procedure) has been
    normalized, so there is now a common syntax for all imperative routine
    kinds rather than a separate one for each; you can no longer tell what
    kind of imperative routine that code is invoking by its syntax, but
    rather just by either the routine name or the kind of routine doing the
    invoking.  The prior design essentially had gratuitous strong typing
    where there was distinct but alike syntax for invoking each kind of
    routine; but for that purpose it wasn't worth it as other tests would
    have to be done anyway, and the latter will now just be the only tests,
    and sufficient themselves.  In Types_Catalog.pod, merged the 2 nearly
    identical catalog types "Multi[Upd|Rcp]InvoStmt" into the 1
    "MultiUpdStmt" (which is also a reversal of one aspect of release
    0.115.0), and the 3 "[Upd|Rcp|Proc]InvoStmtNodeSet" into the 1
    "ImpInvoStmtNodeSet", and the 6 "[A|R]P[Updater|Recipe|Procedure]NC"
    into the 2 "[A|R]PImperativeNC".  Also updated the catalog type
    "Recipe" to merge its 2 attributes "stmt_part_[upd|rcp]" into the 1
    "stmt".  Also updated the catalog type "StmtNodeSet" to merge its 3
    attributes "[upd|rcp|proc]_invo_stmts" into the 1 "imp_invo_stmts".  In
    Routines_Catalog.pod, merged the 3 routines "[upd|rcp|proc]_invo" into
    the 1 "imp_invo".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In all 3 STD.pod, updated the
    "DBMS Entity Name Literals" pod sub-section to remove the special case
    of a "PNSQNameChain" value node kind where it might be interpreted with
    a "topic" chain element prepended.  In the 2 Perl-STD, this shorthand
    is now just gone and you'll have to write "topic.attr" rather than
    ".attr".  In PTMD_STD, also updated the "Generic Expression Attribute
    Accessors" pod sub-section to add a variant of the acc-via-named format
    that restores the "topic"-prepending shorthand which was removed from
    PNSQNameChain, but for PTMD_STD only.  Considering other recent spec
    changes, an attribute-accessor is the *only* place where ".attr" could
    have been used anyway.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the catalog type "DataNC" to change its
    default value from "lex.topic" to "sys.cat" (which is also a reversal
    of one aspect of release 0.115.0).

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)
    Further simplified the system catalog and all standard grammars by
    eliminating completely the "lex" primary entity namespace as something
    that is actually used in entity references in code.  Release 0.115.0
    had mostly put the nails in its coffin and the current release is
    basically cleaning up and removing the last vestiges, because "lex" is
    now completely redundant for actual use, as any context that lets you
    reference a lexical entity can't reference anything but a lexical
    entity, and likewise for not-lexical entities.  In Basics.pod, split
    the pod sub-section "User-Defined Entities" in 2, with the last
    paragraph, about "lex", forming a new pod sub-section "Lexical
    Entities", which was then expanded to explain that "lex" is now just a
    concept and is no longer actually useable in code; similarly updated
    the namespace graph under "ENTITY NAMES".  In Types_Catalog.pod,
    removed the catalog type "LexDataNC", and updated each catalog type
    having an attribute of "LexDataNC" so that said attribute's declared
    type is now "Name" instead, except for just "AccExprNodeSet" where its
    "target" attribute is now a "NameChain" instead.  Also updated each of
    the 3 catalog types "PNSQNameChain", "DataNC", "SysNspSet" to remove
    "lex[|.*]" from its value list.  In all 3 STD.pod, updated the
    "PNSQNameChain" value node kind to remove "lex.*" from its value list,
    and remove the special shorthand syntax where it might be interpreted
    with a "lex" chain element prepended.  Also updated the
    "AccExprNodeSet" node kind to change its last element's kind from
    "PNSQNameChain" to "NameChain".

    * Muldis::D version 0.116.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.116.0.tar.gz.

    * This release partly features the addition of an initial complement of
    system-defined mixin types, specifically "Ordered" and "Ordinal", where
    the latter is a more specific example of, and composes, the former.  A
    type would compose "Ordered" if it is an ordered type, such that you
    can take all of its values and arrange them on a line in some
    definitive order where every value can be said is "before" all values
    on one side and "after" all values on the other side.  A type would
    compose "Ordinal" if it is an ordinal type, such that between every
    pair of values there is a known finite count of values between them,
    and those can be enumerated in order.  Ordered/ordinal types tend to be
    scalar types, but they don't have to be.  Ordered types like "Bool" and
    "Int" are also ordinal, while ordered types like "Rat", "Blob", "Text"
    are not also ordinal.  Further to this new feature, various
    ordered-sensitive functions were refactored, such that we see the first
    system-defined virtual functions and implementing counterparts; the
    "order" virtual is for all ordered types, and the two "pred","succ" for
    "ordinal".  And so, now "order"/"<=>" in particular is now a properly
    elegant generic overloaded operator such as any user can make, rather
    than a special case with specific support in the system catalog.  And
    "--","++" ("pred","succ") are no longer integer-specific.

    * This release partly features large enhancements to the system catalog
    and concrete grammars that improve support for the preservation of
    non-behaviour-impacting metadata in Muldis D source code, such as code
    comments and code element ordinal positions, which is important for
    helping the code to be easier to read and update by programmers, and
    for helping deparsed or translated code better resemble the original.
    (Actually, some of the intended improvements for comments didn't make
    it, so they are pending in a future release.)

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Updated the "create_depot_mount" recipe to
    add the boolean parameter "allow_auto_run"; this should have been done
    in release 0.114.0 but wasn't.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)
    In Types_Catalog.pod, added the 2 new singleton scalar types
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.[-Inf|Inf]", which are canonical minimum-most
    and maximum-most values for the entire Muldis D type system; they would
    compare as "before" or "after" all other "Universal" values,
    respectively.  Also added the new union type
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.Singleton" which ranges over just the 2 new
    infinity values for now.  In Basics.pod, updated the "NOTES ON TEXT
    CHARACTER LITERALS" main pod section to add "∞" to the list.  In all 3
    STD.pod, added new pod sub-section named "Singleton Literals" to the
    start of the main pod section "OPAQUE VALUE LITERALS", which declares
    specific literal/selector syntax, as a new "Singleton" value node kind,
    for every singleton value that "Singleton" ranges over, in this case
    just "-Inf" and "Inf".  Also in PTMD_STD.pod, made "Singleton" the 9th
    value node kind whose values may all omit the "value_kind" portion of a
    GCVL for brevity.  Also in HDMD_Perl6_STD.pod, added the 2 special Perl
    6 values "-Inf" and "Inf|+Inf" to the data types for which a GCVL may
    alternately be just its payload for brevity.  Also in
    Types_Catalog.pod, updated the catalog type "OVLScalar" to add
    "Singleton" to what it ranges over.

    * (Types.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In Types.pod,
    updated the 2 data types "[S|M]PInterval" so that they now also support
    unbounded/infinite intervals, which is accomplished by using the 2 new
    infinity values "-Inf", "Inf" as interval endpoints.  Also changed the
    default value of "SPInterval" to have "Inf" and "-Inf" for its "min"
    and "max" attributes, rather than "True" and "False"; it still
    represents the empty interval, same as before, though.  In all 3
    STD.pod, updated the "Interval Selectors" pod sub-section to add a new
    code example demonstrating an unbounded multi-part interval literal.

    * (Ordered.pod)  Updated the 3 functions "min|max|minmax" to use the 2
    new infinity values, as appropriate, as identity values when the
    functions' topic arguments have zero elements, rather than the
    functions failing.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Temporal.pod)  In Types.pod, added new
    main pod section "GENERIC MIXIN DATA TYPES", just prior to "GENERIC
    SCALAR DATA TYPES", which declares the 2 new mixin types
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Ord[ered|inal]".  Also updated the descriptions of
    the 5 scalar types "Bool","Int","Rat","Blob","Text" so that the last 3
    directly compose the "Ordered" type and the first 2 directly compose
    the "Ordinal" type (and indirectly the "Ordered" type).  In
    Types_Catalog.pod, updated the descriptions of the 7 scalar types
    "String","Name","NameChain","Comment","Order","-Inf", "Inf" so that the
    first 4 directly compose "Ordered" and the last 3 directly compose
    "Ordinal".  In Temporal.pod, updated the descriptions of the 5 scalar
    types "[TAI|UTC|Float]Instant", "[TAI|UTC]Duration" so that they
    directly compose "Ordered".  In all 3 files, updated "TYPE SUMMARY" to
    add a graph slice showing types composing mixins grouped by the latter.

    * (Ordered.pod, Scalar.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, Array.pod, Interval.pod,
    Tuple.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Moved the function
    "sys.std.Core.Scalar.order" from Scalar.pod to Ordered.pod, in the
    process renaming it to "sys.std.Core.Ordered.order".  Updated the
    references to that function in 6 files to use the new name.

    * (Ordered.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Boolean.pod, Integer.pod,
    Rational.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod, Temporal.pod)  In Ordered.pod,
    redefined the "order" function to specifically say that it is a virtual
    function; updated its signature to specify this by adding the "@"
    character to the end of the "topic" and "other" parameters, which
    designates them as "dispatch params", and having at least one of those
    is part of how a routine is marked as virtual (besides having no
    defined routine body); also wrapped "order" in a new main pod section
    "VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS FOR THE ORDERED MIXIN TYPE", and updated its
    description.  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated each of the 2 catalog types
    "[Scalar|Domain]Type" to remove its "order" attribute, since an ordered
    type no longer specifies its default order-determination function in
    the type definition itself.  In each of the other 6 files, added a new
    main pod section "FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTING VIRTUAL ORDERED FUNCTIONS"
    which contains one or more functions with "order" unqualified names,
    each of which has a signature like the virtual "order" but for more
    specific types, no "@", and "implements sys.std.Core.Ordered.order"
    appended, which is how the virtual-implementer association is defined;
    Temporal.pod had 5 "order" functions, for its 5 main types, and the
    other 5-of-6 files have one "order" function each.

    * (Ordered.pod, Integer.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, Boolean.pod)  In
    Ordered.pod, added new main pod section "VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS FOR THE
    ORDINAL MIXIN TYPE" which includes the 2 new virtual functions
    "sys.std.Core.Ordered.Ordinal.[pred|succ]"; these functions are
    generalized copies of Integer.pod's "sys.std.Core.Integer.[pred|succ]";
    in Integer.pod, updated the latter 2 functions to make them implement
    the 2 new functions rather than being standalone, and wrapped up the
    latter 2 in a new main pod section "FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTING VIRTUAL
    ORDINAL FUNCTIONS".  In PTMD_STD.pod, and the first 2 files, reflected
    that the special postfix alternate function syntaxes "--","++" are now
    for "Ordinal.[pred|succ]" rather than the "Integer" versions.  In
    Boolean.pod, added the 2 "sys.std.Core.Boolean.[pred|succ]" functions
    in their own new "... ORDINAL ..." main pod section.

    * (Scalar.pod)  Updated all of the function signatures having a
    "possrep" parameter so that any other parameters whose declared type
    was "Scalar" is now "ScalarWP" instead.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the pod sub-section
    "Generic If-Else Expressions" to update a code example to use a specced
    "is_empty" func-invo node instead of unspecced "is-empty" alt-syn node.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Added the 2 new functions
    "sys.std.Temporal.[TAI|UTC]Duration.abs_diff", so now every temporal
    type consistently has at least the 2 functions "diff" and "abs_diff".

    * (D.pm, Basics.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Counted.pod)  Fixed all misspellings of
    'metadata' (using 'meta-data' was incorrect).

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated every (nonscalar) catalog
    type having a "comment" attribute to rename th latter to "scm_comment".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated each of these 2 (nonscalar) catalog
    types to add a "scm_comment" (source code metadata code comment)
    attribute: "RcpGlobalVarAliasMap", "NameTypeMap".  And so, one can now
    attach a comment specifically to a declaration of a single type
    attribute or routine parameter or variable, etc.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated each of these 52 (nonscalar) catalog
    types to add a "scm_vis_ord" (source code metadata visual element
    order) attribute, of type "NNInt": "Sys[Nsp|SpecType|Cat]Set",
    "SubdepotSet", "[|Sys][Function|Updater|Recipe|Procedure]Set",
    "[|Sys][Scalar|Tuple|Relation|Domain|Subset|Mixin]TypeSet",
    "OVLScaValExprNodeSet",
    "[Sca|Tup|Rel|Set|Ary|Bag|[S|M]PIvl|List]SelExprNodeSet",
    "[Acc|FuncInvo|IfElse|GivenWhenDef|APMaterialNCSel]ExprNodeSet",
    "Multi[Upd|Rcp]InvoStmt", "RcpGlobalVarAliasMap", "PossrepSet",
    "VirtualAttrMapSet", "[|Distrib][Key|SubsetConstr]Set", "NameTypeMap",
    "NameExprMap", "NameNCMap", "AttrRenameMap".

    * (Basics.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  In Basics.pod, added new main pod section
    near the end named "SOURCE CODE METADATA", with the initial 2
    sub-sections "Code Comments" and "Visual Element Order"; these outline
    how the Muldis D system catalog supports the storage of explicit
    metadata, currently code comments and ordinal code element positions,
    that has no impact on the behaviour of the code but is important for
    human readers or updaters of the code; these also provide some detail
    the intended interpretation of this metadata and how concrete grammars
    should work with it.  In PTMD_STD.pod, added a paragraph to the
    "plain_rtn_inv" pod sub-section to say that parsers which support this
    or higher catalog abstr levels should preserve all prev desc metadata.

2010-04-02  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.115.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.115.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a redefinition of "recipe" to become the 4th
    main routine kind (besides function, updater, procedure), rather than
    being a special case of a procedure.  A "recipe" is now firmly between
    an updater and a procedure; it is exactly the same as an updater except
    that it can see and update global variables; moreover, a procedure has
    been stripped of the ability to do that directly; a procedure must now
    invoke a recipe to use the database.  From now on, it is expected that
    most typical user code, that analogous to typical database query or
    data manipulation or data definition code, would now be written
    primarily as recipes, since a single recipe can do everything that is
    possible in Muldis D to do as a single atomic and deterministic action.
    Now, the only reason to write a "procedure" is if you want to write
    something nonatomic or nondeterministic natively in Muldis D; in
    general practice for a mixed-language application, you would tend to do
    nondeterministic stuff in your main application language instead; a
    borderline case is fetching the current date or time, which is commonly
    done close to a database for timestamps, and it is nondeterministic.

    * (Basics.pod)  Made several large updates to the "ROUTINES" main pod
    section, mostly in its sub-section "Functions, Updaters, and
    Procedures", which was also renamed to add "Recipes, "; these updates
    focused on adding the "recipe" 4th main routine kind, and reducing the
    capabilities of "procedure"; in the "Kinds of Procedures" sub-section,
    removed the paragraph for the old definition of "recipe".

    * (Basics.pod)  Made multiple small updates with respect to
    transactions, partly to specify that Muldis D now uses a
    multi-versioned concurrency model, and also to say that all
    transactions are now serializable.  These updates were in the 2 main
    pod sections "TRANSACTIONS AND CONCURRENCY" and "ROUTINES".  The Muldis
    D spec still doesn't go into detail on how the concurrency model works,
    but that will come eventually, though no longer a high priority item.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the catalog type "DataNC" to change its
    default value from "sys.cat" to "lex.topic", and that is now the
    default value of "LexDataNC" also.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the catalog type "MultiUpdStmt"
    to "MultiUpdInvoStmt".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod)  In Types_Catalog.pod,
    removed the old "Recipe" catalog type, which was a proper subtype of
    "Procedure", and updated the "Procedure" type to remove its "is_recipe"
    attribute.  Also updated all data types used just in defining procedure
    statements to change the declared types of any of their "DataNC"
    attributes to "LexDataNC".  In Routines_Catalog.pod, changed the "noop"
    routine from a recipe to a procedure.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added the new routine generator called
    "recipe" which now defines the only routines that can see or update
    global variables, and they are also atomic.  In Types_Catalog.pod,
    added the catalog type "Recipe", which is mostly a clone of "Updater"
    but for having the 2 extra attributes "[upd|ro]_globals" and for
    replacing the 1 "stmt" attribute with the 2 "stmt_part_[upd|rcp]";
    supporting that, also added the 2 catalog types "RcpGlobalVarAliasMap"
    and "MultiRcpInvoStmt", where the latter is mostly a clone of
    "MultiUpdInvoStmt" save for the "updater" attribute being renamed to
    "recipe".  Also added the 2 catalog types "[|Sys]RecipeSet", and
    updated each of the 2 catalog types "System", "Depot" to add a
    "recipes" attribute.  Also added the 2 catalog types "[A|R]PRecipeNC".
    In Routines_Catalog.pod, added the 3 recipes "rcp_invo",
    "[create|drop]_recipe".  Also added new catalog type
    "RcpInvoStmtNodeSet", which is a clone of "UpdInvoStmtNodeSet" but for
    one renamed attribute, and updated the "StmtNodeSet" catalog type to
    add a "rcp_invo_stmts" attribute.
    In all 3 STD.pod, added "Recipe Specification" pod sub-section under
    "MATERIAL SPECIFICATION" and added the "recipe" material node kind.

    * (Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  Moved the 2 functions
    "sys.std.Core.Tuple.is[|_not]_member" from Tuple.pod to Relation.pod,
    in the process renaming them to
    "sys.std.Core.Relation.tuple_is[|_not]_member".  Updated the references
    to those functions in PTMD_STD.pod to use the new names.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the 2 pod sub-sections "Simple Commutative
    N-adic Infix Reduction Operators" and "Simple Non-symmetric Dyadic
    Infix Operators", to remove the 5 alternate syntaxes for relational/set
    operators which were spelled "R[+*%-/]"; these were attempts to reuse
    math op syntax for relational/set ops as does happen in other projects;
    they were deemed not similar enough to the loosely-corresponding math
    ops, and so were confusing; and, each of the relational/set ops already
    had at least 2 other, better alt syn; the removed were superfluous.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the 2 pod
    sub-sections "Simple Non-symmetric Dyadic Infix Operators" and "Order
    Comparison Operators", to rename the alternate syntaxes for 14
    membership-testing functions so that they read better.  The spellings
    were changed as follows:
    from "[S|B|I][[|!|not-]in|∈|∉]" to "[[|!|not-]in-|∈|∉][s|b|i]",
    from "[S|B|I][[|!|not-]has|∋|∌]" to "[s|b|i][-[|!|not-]has|∋|∌]",
    from "[[|!|not-]has-|∋|∌]t" to "r[-[|!|not-]has|∋|∌]".  The spellings
    for the 2 related functions were left unchanged: "[[|!|not-]in-|∈|∉]r".

    * (Relation.pod, Set.pod, Bag.pod, Interval.pod)  Updated the
    also-known-as notes for the 14 membership-testing functions in
    correspondence to above-mentioned changes.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the 7 pod
    sub-sections "Simple [C|Non-c]ommutative N-adic Infix Reduction
    Operators", "Simple [S|Non-s]ymmetric Dyadic Infix Operators", "Simple
    Monadic P[re|ost]fix Operators", "Order Comparison Operators", to
    rename the alternate syntaxes for 15 math functions, 6 string
    functions, and 1 relational function, so that they read better.  The
    spellings were changed as follows:
    from "[I|N][+|*|-|/|^]" to "[i|r][+|*|-|/|^]",
    from "I|-|" to "i|-|", from "I||" to "i||", from "I!" to "i!",
    from "N|-|" to "r|-|", from "N||" to "r||",
    from "[B|T|A]~" to "[b|t|a]~", from "[B|T|A]x" to "[b|t|a]-x",
    from "R#" to "r#".

    * (Integer.pod, Rational.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod, Array.pod,
    Relation.pod)  Updated the also-known-as notes for the 22 functions in
    correspondence to above-mentioned changes.

    * Updated the TODO file so that now there are only 2 highest-priority
    items, which are adding the Ordered/Ordinal mixins, and specifying the
    concrete syntax for defining types and routines.

2010-03-27  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.114.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.114.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a rough cut of a refactor of the entire Muldis
    D type hierarchy at a fundamental level; this introduces the new
    concept of the "low-level type system" over which the previously
    existing, and still maintained mostly intact, type system is now an
    abstraction.  In the new low-level type system, there are exactly 2
    "declaration" types, the system-defined "Int" and "List", which are now
    the only types that introduce values into the type system; now, *all*
    other types, including all user-defined types, are just "enumeration"
    types, which reuse values from said 2 types, and are defined just in
    terms of either a subset or a union of other types.  The "Int" type is
    exactly the same as in the previous release, consisting of just atomic
    integer values, and is the sole Muldis D atomic type.  The "List"
    type is the sole Muldis D nonatomic type, each value being a dense
    sequence of 0..N elements where each element is an "Int" or a "List".
    The fundamental reason for this design, where all values are introduced
    into the type system by just system-defined types, is so that Muldis D
    can support doing data definition plus data manipulation as a single
    atomic operation.  This is because there is an effective way to
    represent and interpret all Muldis D values in the complete absence of
    any user-defined types, so there is no chicken-and-egg problem that
    prevents DD+DM from being done together in the general case, where one
    needs to have non-mutating definitions of user-defined types in order
    to do manipulation of data having those types.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Fix fossil in docs about whitespace in char str lits.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the "MountControlSet" catalog type to
    add an 8th, boolean attribute "allow_auto_run", which is primarily
    intended to provide a measure of security against viruses and other
    malware that are using Muldis D databases as a vector, especially where
    the malicious code is setup to run automatically as soon as its host
    depot is mounted.  When you have a depot with a dubious history,
    mounting it initially with a false "allow_auto_run" will allow you to
    examine the depot for malware without giving the latter any opportunity
    to run; moreover, you will be able to clean out a virus infection from
    a depot that you otherwise wish to preserve; and then you can remount
    the depot with a true "allow_auto_run" once you know it is clean, in
    order for benign auto-running code to work.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Interval.pod)  Eliminated all
    of the triadic order comparison operator syntaxes, whose usage would
    look like "1 <= $n < 10", because their support unnecessarily
    complicated the grammar and also they were completely redundant with
    interval membership-test operators, whose usage would look like "$n in
    SPInterval:{1..10}".  In all 3 STD.pod, updated the pod sub-section
    "Order Comparison Operators" to remove the "triadic_compare_op_invo"
    grammar node plus all associated documentation and code examples; then
    refactored the remaining grammar to merge the 10 nodes
    "dyadic_compare_op", "is_[before|after]_op[|__op_cr_[basic|extended]]",
    "interval_membership_op[|__op_cr_[basic|extended]]" into the 3 nodes
    "dyadic_compare_op[|__op_cr_[basic|extended]]".  Also updated the main
    pod section "NESTING PRECEDENCE RULES" to remove the one of the 8
    precedence levels that was specific to the removed triadic operators
    (so it wouldn't mis-parse as a pair of dyadic operators).  In
    Interval.pod, updated the also-known-as notes for the 2
    "value_is[|_not]_member" to excise mentions of such as "!≤≤".

    * (Types.pod, README, Core.pod, Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)
    Reordered any lists of core data types or related materials so that the
    "Rat" types now always precede the "Blob" and "Text" types rather than
    follow them.  In Types.pod, moved the pod sub-sections that declare the
    3 types "[|NN|P]Rat" so they are now just prior to "Blob", and updated
    the "TYPE SUMMARY" section accordingly.  In the README file and
    Core.pod, moved the reference to Rational.pod upwards to just prior to
    Blob.pod.  In Basics.pod and Types_Catalog.pod, reordered a few lists
    of type names in descriptive paragraphs.  No changes were needed in the
    3 STD.pod as they already used the desired ordering for value literals.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Rational.pod, Cast.pod, Temporal.pod)
    In a reversal of one aspect of release 0.51.0, removed the annotations
    on all of the Muldis D data type definitions, either individually or by
    documentation section, that said which of the main 4 type categories
    (primitive, structure, enumeration, reference) each type belonged to.
    This was because these notes would be superfluous following a subseq
    change item where *all* types but exactly 2 became enumeration types.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Replaced the prior
    concept of a "reference type" (as represented by the "Reference" type)
    with the concept of an "external type", which for all practical
    purposes was a no-op since the only system defined subtype of
    "Reference" was "External".  In Types.pod, removed the declaration of
    the type "Reference", promoted "External" into its place in the type
    graph of "TYPE SUMMARY", and renamed the "GENERIC REFERENCE TYPES" main
    pod section to "GENERIC EXTERNAL TYPES".  In Basics.pod, updated the
    "TYPE SYSTEM" main pod section, and its "Type Identification"
    sub-section, to rename the "reference type" concept to "external type",
    and moved the paragraph describing this concept downwards from that
    main section to that sub-section.  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the
    description of the "special_types" attribute of the "System" catalog
    type to remove "Reference" from its list.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added the 2 new scalar enumeration types
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.[|DH]ScalarWP" which serve as maximal types of
    all scalar values which have any possreps, meaning all scalar values
    except for those of "Int", which is atomic.  "ScalarWP" is the
    difference type of subtracting "Int" from "Scalar", and "DHScalarWP" is
    the intersection type of "ScalarWP" and "DHScalar".  These types were
    added at the top of the "SIMPLE GENERIC SCALAR TYPES" main pod section.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Rational.pod, Cast.pod, Temporal.pod,
    Spatial.pod)  In Types.pod and Types_Catalog.pod, did some major
    refactoring of the "TYPE SUMMARY" main pod section, featuring the
    splitting of the main type graph into multiple graphs that are easier
    to read, some showing different views of the same type relationships.
    In Temporal.pod, did a smaller refactoring of its "TYPE SUMMARY".  In
    all 6 files, updated their "TYPE SUMMARY" to do some basic cleanup,
    including the addition of a few instances of "[|DH]ScalarWP", and
    including the collective removal of most instances of the "Empty" or
    "OVLScalar" type from the graph, those being superfluous; now, "Empty"
    and "OVLScalar" only appear in graphs of the files that declare them.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod, Types.pod, Scalar.pod, Array.pod,
    PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In a reversal of one aspect of
    release 0.61.0, and also of one aspect of release 0.109.0,
    converted "String" into a primitive scalar type with no
    possreps, which is a dense sequence of integers, rather than it being a
    nonscalar subtype of "Array"; this all is just a
    refactor, and the semantics of "String" are unchanged.  In
    Types_Catalog.pod, changed the definition of the "String" type to say
    it is now the aforementioned primitive scalar type, and updated the
    "TYPE SUMMARY" section accordingly; also merged the main pod section
    "SIMPLE GENERIC STRING TYPES" into "SIMPLE GENERIC SCALAR TYPES" with
    the declarations of the 4 types "[|B|O|UCP]String" being moved up just
    prior to "Name".  Also updated the description of the "special_types"
    attribute of the "System" catalog type to add "String" to its list.  In
    Basics.pod, updated a few paragraphs in the "TYPE SYSTEM" main pod
    section and its subsections as appropriate for the new status of
    "String".  In Types.pod, Scalar.pod, and Array.pod, updated a few
    description paragraphs likewise.  In all 3 STD.pod files, updated the
    "Scalar" node kind description and removed a code example from the
    "Array" node kind, concerning "String"; also updated the code examples
    for "the_floor" to temporarily use a stand-in "String:[...]" syntax,
    since an "Array" can't be used anymore; however, the "String" value
    literal node that release 0.109.0 removed has not also been restored,
    which isn't a problem since a subseq change item adds an alternative.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Types.pod)  Added the 3 new catalog
    types "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.[List|[S|Nons]ructure", where "List"
    contains every type system value that "Int" doesn't, "Structure"
    contains every "List" value that is a scalar or nonscalar or external
    value, and "Nonstructure" contains every "List" value that "Structure"
    doesn't; these were declared in the new main pod section of
    Types_Catalog.pod named "LOW-LEVEL STRUCTURE TYPES", added just prior
    to "SIMPLE GENERIC SCALAR TYPES".  A "List" is a dense sequence of
    elements where each element is either an "Int" or a "List".  Redefined
    the "String" type to be a "List" proper subtype, so each of its integer
    elements is now an actual "Int"; it still has no scalar possreps,
    though.  Redefined the "Tuple" and "Relation" types to be "List" proper
    subtypes, such that their attribute lists are now "List" values with
    one element per attribute, and their headings or bodies are now
    expressed as "List", and a relation body is now a list of lists, and
    for nonscalars you can now choose "row-oriented" and "column-oriented"
    formats which are logically equivalent.  Redefined "ScalarWP" to be a
    "List" proper subtype whose explicit elements spell out the "type
    name", "possrep name", and "possrep attributes" of a scalar value; the
    first 2 are "String" and the last is a "Tuple".  Redefined the
    "External" type to be a "List" proper subtype, and it is now just
    conceptually opaque rather than actually, but its payload format is
    still implementation-defined.  In both Types.pod and Types_Catalog.pod,
    updated the "TYPE SUMMARY" sections to add the 3 new types and to
    otherwise reflect the new state of affairs; also updated the
    descriptions of these existing 12 types to reflect their additional
    natures in light of the low-level type system: "Universal", "Empty",
    "[|DH]Scalar", "Tuple", "Relation", "External", "ScalarWP",
    "[|B|O|UCP]String".  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the description of
    the "special_types" attribute of the "System" catalog type to remove
    the 5 types "Scalar", "String", "Tuple", "Relation", "External" from
    its list, and add the 1 type "List" to its list, and leaving the 3
    types "Universal", "Empty", "Int" unchanged.  In Basics.pod, several
    major updates in the "TYPE SYSTEM" main pod section plus sub-sections.
    Rewrote the main section paragraphs that introduced the 4 main type
    categories "primitive", "structure", "reference", "enumeration" so to
    replace them with the 2 main categories "declaration" and
    "enumeration"; also added a paragraph giving rationale for the new
    design.  Updated the "Type Identification" sub-section to add the
    "nonstructure" 5th category to the alternate 4 main value categories
    "scalar", "tuple", "relation", "external".  Updated the "Distinction of
    Non-Homogeneous Types from Homogeneous Types" sub-section to add a
    paragraph specifying that DH types exclude external and and
    nonstructure valued attributes.  Added new pod sub-section "Low Level
    Type System" in "TYPE SYSTEM" that introduces and details the new
    "low-level type system" concept, where "Int" are the atoms, "List"
    compose those, and all other main types are "List" with particular
    formats.  A consequence of these changes is that now Muldis D has
    values which are neither scalar nor nonscalar nor external, though
    users should never really encounter these in practice as all the normal
    system-defined routines are closed over scalars and nonscalars.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added new catalog type "ListSelExprNodeSet"
    which provides a means to select any "List" value at all in terms of a
    sequence of elements whose values may all be determined at runtime. It
    is completely redundant for selecting tuple and relation values and
    scalar values with possreps, but it currently provides the only means
    to directly select "List" values that are "String" or external or
    nonstructure values, not that any normal users should be doing that.
    Also updated the catalog type "ExprNodeSet" to add a 15th attribute
    "list_sel_exprs" of the new catalog type.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added new pod sub-section
    named "Low Level List Selectors" to the end of the main pod section
    "COLLECTION VALUE SELECTORS", which declares new literal/selector
    syntax specific to generic "List" values; this syntax takes the form of
    the new "List" value node kind, which looks exactly like the "Array"
    value node kind save for the keyword.  The new sub-sections include
    several code examples showing how to select scalar and nonscalar values
    just in terms of "List".  Also updated the definition of the grammar
    node "value__the_floor" so that it can only consist of "Int" and "List"
    nodes, rather than "Int|Scalar|Tuple|Relation" nodes, since that is the
    new minimal syntax for the catalog abstraction level "the_floor".  Also
    obligatorily updated the code examples for "the_floor" to show how the
    same 2x2 relation value is represented just in terms of "List" and
    "Int"; the primary difference from all the prior iterations of this
    code is that now all type and possrep and attribute names are *also*
    expressed as strings of integers like the values, not as characters.

    * Updated the TODO file concerning stimulus-response rules and DBMS
    command-line parameters.  Also updated the TODO file concerning the
    combination of related 'catalog' and 'data' into single values that are
    binary tuples, where a value effectively defines its own constraints,
    and that each "version" of a multi-versioned depot is one, and so using
    those, just functions or updaters can do what 'recipe' were needed for.

2010-03-13  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.113.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.113.0.tar.gz.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Other minor fixes.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Expanded the routine overloading
    feature so that multiple virtual routines may be directly implemented
    by the same other routine, should this be useful.  In Basics.pod,
    updated the "Overloading With Virtual Routines" pod sub-section.  In
    Types_Catalog.pod, updated the "implements" attribute of the 3 catalog
    types "Function", "Updater", "Procedure" so it is a Set, not a Maybe.

    * (Basics.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod)  Made a few small terminology
    fixes; "modulo" is a name for the "remainder"|"%"|"mod" operation, and
    "modulus" is a name for the result of that operation; "modulus" is also
    an alternate name for the "abs"/"absolute value" operation; update or
    add notes about this where appropriate; in general, just don't use the
    word "modulus" at all to save on ambiguity.

    * Renamed Bool.pod to Boolean.pod; the entities it declares have
    all been renamed to "sys.std.Boolean.\w+" from "sys.std.Bool.\w+".
    Any references to these in other files [Core.pod, the README
    file, PTMD_STD.pod] were updated accordingly.

    * In a reversal of one aspect of release 0.101.0, split up
    Universal.pod into itself and new file Ordered.pod; moved the 10
    ordered-sensitive functions of Universal.pod into Ordered.pod, renaming
    each one from the "Universal." name-space to the "Ordered." name-space.
    Any references to these in other files [Core.pod, the README file,
    PTMD_STD.pod] were updated accordingly.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Cast.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)
    In Types_Catalog.pod, renamed the catalog type "RatRoundMeth" to
    "RoundMeth", and its 7 singleton subtypes likewise.  Any references to
    these, in the other 4 files, were updated accordingly.  In all 3
    STD.pod, renamed the "Rational Rounding Method Literals" pod
    sub-section to remove "Rational", and renamed the "RatRoundMeth" node
    kind to "RoundMeth".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In
    Types_Catalog.pod, refactored the catalog type "RoundMeth" and its
    singleton subtypes as follows:  Renamed the 2 singletons "ToFloor",
    "ToCeiling" to "Down", "Up" respectively.  Added 2 new singletons
    "HalfToZero", "HalfToInf".  And so "RoundMeth" now has 9 values, which
    were also reordered, where 8 form a 2x4 table crossing
    [always-to,half-to] with [down,up,zero,nearest-infinity], and
    "half-even" being (while important) somewhat the odd one out.  Any
    references to these, in the 3 STD.pod files, were updated accordingly.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the catalog type "RoundMeth" to change
    its default value from "HalfUp" to "HalfEven", since in general that
    should be the rounding method most likely to minimize the rounding
    error from a sequence of operations that each round, which is
    especially useful in contexts where a rounding method is implicit.
    Similarly updated the default value of the "RatRoundRule" type.

    * (Integer.pod)  Updated the 6 functions
    "[|maybe_][quotient|remainder|quot_and_rem]" to add a mandatory third
    parameter "round_meth", so that the functions' result rounding
    semantics, when "divisor" doesn't go into "dividend" evenly, can be
    customized by the user, and also make the invoking code more
    self-documenting.  The reason that "round_meth" is mandatory is that
    there are no commonly accepted semantics, either in programming
    languages or otherwise, for a normal rounding method to use implicitly,
    and so there would be a variety of implicit user expectations, and so
    spelling out the method explicitly should prevent any bugs due to false
    assumptions.  Use "Down" to get the currently-defined semantics of
    Perl 6's Int-specific ops ("div", "mod"), or Knuth (according to WP);
    use "ToZero" to get the semantics of some other languages.  Previously
    the exact semantics of these functions was not defined and was left
    implicit.  Furthermore, updated the description of "remainder" to
    specify that it preserves the identity "$x % $y = $x - $y * ($x / $y)";
    your choice of "round_meth" has an even more pronounced effect here.

    * (Integer.pod)  Added Int-specific analogies of some Rat-specific
    operators that didn't exist before, where there was no particularly
    strong reason for Int to lack ops that Rat has.  Added the 3
    "sys.std.Core.Integer.\w+" operators "[|maybe_]mean", "mean_of_median";
    their semantics follow "quotient", meaning floor rounding.  They all
    have been given "round_meth" params also, follow "quotient" semantics.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Loosened the definition of "unspace" a bit so that
    the whitespace between its pair of backslashes is now optional, so one
    may now use them for visual code alignment more effectively if wanted.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Made the grammar stricter with regards to several
    situations where optional whitespace used to be allowed; in those
    situations, whitespace is now prohibited except in the form of an
    "unspace": 1. In a "language_name" token preceeding a ":" element
    separator. 2. In a generic-context value literal / value node following
    a ":" element separator. 3. In any value literal payload following a
    ";" pair-payload element separator. 4. In a rational number body around
    the [/,*,^] element separators. 5. In a name-chain around the "."
    chain-element separators. 6. In an "accessor" node around the "."
    element separator. 7. In all of the "Simple Postcircumfix Operators"
    between the base expression and its postfix portion.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Made the grammar looser with regards to several
    situations where no whitespace used to be allowed, such that "unspace"
    is now also allowed there: 1. In a rational number body preceeding a
    "." radix point. 2. In a "func_invo" between the routine name and its
    argument list.

    * More TODO file additions or changes.

2010-03-10  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.112.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.112.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a rough cut of a new major feature of the
    Muldis D type system, called "mixin types", which is analogous to the
    "roles" of Perl 6, or to the "mixins" or "interfaces" of some other
    general purpose languages.  The new feature now does, or will in a
    near-subsequent release, support multiple kinds of important
    functionality that were either previously missing from Muldis D or were
    implemented in a less elegant manner.  The first new functionality is
    that a union type can now be declared in the reverse manner to how it
    was previously doable using a "domain type"; a domain type definition
    explicitly lists all the other types it ranges over, so it is "closed";
    in contrast, a "mixin type" is a union type that ranges over other
    types that specify themselves to be part of that union, which the other
    types do by "composing" the mixin type, so a mixin type is "open".  Any
    user-defined type can add itself to the domain of even a system-defined
    mixin-type (such as "Numeric"), whereas no type can add itself to the
    domain of a system-defined domain-type (such as "Bool").  The second
    new functionality is that routines can now be declared virtual and be
    associated with a union type, and other functions which are associated
    with other types that are subtypes of the union can be declared to
    implement that
    virtual function; this means that Muldis D now supports "operator
    overloading" to a limited extent, that limit being that you can only
    overload operators that are explicitly defined to be overloadable; in
    any event, a direct invocation of a virtual routine will automatically
    dispatch to one of its implementing functions based on the data types
    of the "dispatch" routine arguments.  Strictly
    speaking this feature doesn't require mixin types, but with most of the
    likely use cases the union type would be a mixin type and the subtypes
    its composers.  In a subsequent release, mixins
    will support code reuse by way of letting you define type attributes in
    a mixin and then all composing types will have those attributes without
    having to separately define them; this then means Muldis D will support
    an approximation of "specialization by extension".  Having "mixin
    types" also means that some other tangential design changes can be made
    to Muldis D more easily, in subsequent releases.  Note that a refactor
    of the system type hierarchy to exploit mixins has been postponed to
    the next release, so this current release merely adds support for
    mixins without actually using them.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated 3 parts of the "TYPE SYSTEM" main pod section,
    listed here in order of occurrance in the file: 1. Updated the
    paragraph that talked about "specialization by extension" so instead of
    saying that the latter is unsupported (just "specialization by
    constraint"), it now says that "extension" will be supported to some
    approximation in the near future. 2. Updated the paragraph introducing
    the MST (most specific type) concept to chop out the unnecessary second
    half, and updating the remainder to say that Muldis D enforces MSTs
    only in the contexts where it is necessary, if any. 3. Added a whole
    new large paragraph that introduces and distinguishes the 2 main
    methods of defining a type in terms of a type union, "domain types" and
    "mixin types"; users can extend the latter but not the former.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added the new type generator called "mixin
    type" which defines new data types whose values are a union of those
    from the one or more other types that specify themselves to be part of
    that union.  In Types_Catalog.pod, added the catalog type "MixinType"
    (with the initial 2 attributes "comment", "default"), and added the 2
    catalog types "[|Sys]MixinTypeSet", and updated each of the 2 catalog
    types "System", "Depot" to add a "mixin_types" attribute.  In
    Routines_Catalog.pod, added the 2 recipes "[create|drop]_mixin_type".
    In all 3 STD.pod, added "Mixin Type Specification" pod sub-sect under
    "MATERIAL SPECIFICATION" and added the "mixin_type" material node kind.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated all 6 catalog types
    "[Scalar|Tuple|Relation|Domain|Subset|Mixin]Type" to add a
    "composed_mixins" attribute, which is simply a set of type names.

    * (Basics.pod)  In the "ROUTINES" main pod section, added the new pod
    sub-section "Overloading With Virtual Routines" which introduces /
    explains how Muldis D supports operator overloading and how users
    define overloads through "virtual" and "implementing" routines, and
    that every kind of routine (func, updater, proc) is overloadable.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated all 3 catalog types "Function",
    "Updater", "Procedure" to add the 2 attributes "dispatch_params" and
    "implements", where the former is used to declare that a routine is
    virtual / can be overloaded and the latter is used to declare that a
    routine implements another one; "dispatch_params" is simply a set of
    parameter names, and "implements" is a routine name.  Also added the 2
    new data types "RP[Updater|Procedure]NC" that are like "RPFunctionNC".

    * Renamed DateTime.pod to Temporal.pod; the entities it declares have
    all been renamed to "sys.std.Temporal.\w+" from "sys.std.DateTime.\w+".
    Any references to these in other files [D.pm, Core.pod, the README
    file, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod] were updated accordingly.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Corresponding to the previous
    change item, renamed the "date_time" standard syntax extension to
    "temporal", and renamed the "DATE-TIME EXTENSION OPAQUE VALUE LITERALS"
    main pod section to replace "DATE-TIME" with "TEMPORAL".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the 2 pod sub-sections "Simple Non-symmetric
    Dyadic Infix Operators" and "Order Comparison Operators", to rename the
    plain ASCII alternate syntaxes for 16 membership-testing functions
    so that they read better.  The spellings were changed from
    "[|S|B|I][|!|not-][i|h]mem" to "[|S|B|I][|!|not-][in|has]", rspectivly.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the pod sub-section "Simple Non-symmetric
    Dyadic Infix Operators" to rename the alternate syntaxes for 4
    functions that test membership of a generic tuple in a generic
    relation.  The spellings were changed from
    "[[|!|not-][in|has]|∈|∉|∋|∌]" to "[[|!|not-][in-r|has-t]|∈r|∉r|∋t|∌t]",
    respectively.  This change was made to lay groundwork for the next
    release where the Set|Bag|Interval-specific versions of these operators
    would be combined using operator overloading, and the huffmanization
    was re-considered to let those have the shorter/unqualified versions of
    "is","has" etc and so the versions for generic tuples and relations,
    which can't be combined into the same overloads due to type overlaps,
    would get slightly longer names ending in "r" or "t" as appropriate.

    * (Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod, Bag.pod, Interval.pod)  Updated
    the also-known-as notes for the 16 membership-testing functions in
    correspondence to above-mentioned changes.

    * Update the TODO file to rewrite / greatly chop the portion about
    mixins/roles, now that we have a clearer picture of what exactly to be
    doing, and list the top TODO item priorities in order.

2010-03-05  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.111.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.111.0.tar.gz.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the "Boolean Literals" pod sub-section to add
    a keywords-aliases table as if boolean literals were nullary operators.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Made large changes to the feature that allowed
    segmenting long value literals such as to split them over source code
    lines.  Now, a new Perl-6-inspired feature called "unspace" is used; an
    "unspace" token is a pair of backslashes separated by one or more
    whitespace chars (typically a linebreak); you can place an unspace
    token anywhere in a stringy or numeric value literal and the Muldis D
    parser will strip it out, treating the source characters immediately
    before and after the unspace as if they were adjacent.  This feature
    replaces the use of a token for separating literal segments consisting
    of a tilde ("~") char bounded by optional whitespace (typically a
    linebreak on one side).  For numeric literals, that's the total change;
    but for stringy literals, another change is that now there is just one
    pair of string delimiters around the entire literal, rather than one
    around each literal segment, and so the unspace is contained within the
    delimiters rather than being outside it.  A further change is that a
    "non-value-comment" may now contain unspace inside segments, while
    those remain each-segment-is-#-quoted-and-whitespace-separated (a tilde
    was never used for non-value-comment, so for those programmers have a
    choice of both ways to split lines.  Unchanged is identifiers/names can
    only be segmented when quoted, not when barewords.  So a major benefit
    to this change is that now the tilde character is freed up to just have
    the mneumonic of being concerned with strings, same as in Perl 6,
    rather than also being concerned with stitching long numerics et al.

    * (DateTime.pod, Types.pod, Temporal.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod, Core.pod,
    README)  Demoted all of the TAI temporal types and routines from the
    Muldis D language core and consolidated them with all the UTC temporal
    types in the Muldis D DateTime Extension.  So now the core has no
    temporal-concerning entities and all temporal stuff is in the DateTime
    extension.  This change was done in preparation for a more extensive
    refactoring of the group of temporal types to happen in the near
    future, and also to make easier some other language updates which will
    be applied to the remaining core first.  The 2 data types
    "sys.std.Core.Type.[Instant|Duration]" were moved from Types.pod to
    DateTime.pod, and renamed in the process to
    "sys.std.DateTime.Type.TAI[Instant|Duration]".  The 7 functions
    "sys.std.Core.Temporal.Instant.[[|abs_]diff|later|earlier]",
    "sys.std.Core.Temporal.Duration.[abs|sum|diff]" and 1 system-service
    "sys.std.Core.Temporal.Instant.fetch_curr_instant" were moved from
    Temporal.pod to DateTime.pod, and renamed in the process to
    "sys.std.DateTime.TAIInstant.[[|abs_]diff|later|earlier]",
    "sys.std.DateTime.TAIDuration.Duration.[abs|sum|diff]",
    "sys.std.DateTime.TAIInstant.fetch_curr_instant"; the then-empty
    Temporal.pod was subsequently deleted.  Further updated DateTime.pod as
    follows: 1. Updated its NAME and DESCRIPTION text. 2. Renamed 2 of its
    main pod sections from "DATA TYPES FOR UTC-BASED DATES AND TIMES",
    "DATA TYPES FOR TEMPORAL ARTIFACTS" to "FUNCTIONS FOR DATE AND TIME
    MATH", "FUNCTIONS FOR TEMPORAL MATH" respectively.  In all 3 STD.pod,
    renamed the 2 value node kinds "Instant","Duration" to
    "TAIInstant","TAIDuration", and refactored the grammars to demote those
    2 node kinds from the core grammar to the optional "date_time" standard
    syntax extension; the pod sub-section "TAI Temporal Literals" was
    merged into the pod sub-section "Date and Time Literals", which
    reflects the merging of the type/routine defs in the other files; and
    so all grammar specific to temporal entities are now in that syntax
    extension.  Updated Core.pod and the README file to reflect the removal
    of Temporal.pod.  Other minor updates to Basics.pod, Types.pod,
    Types_Catalog.pod to reflect the renaming of the 2 TAI temporal types.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Other minor updates or fixes.

2010-03-01  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.110.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.110.0.tar.gz.

    * (Set.pod)  Updated ord-det function "sys.std.Core.Set.Maybe.order" to
    add an "is_reverse_order" parameter, which it was lacking, and also
    renamed (and reordered) 3 other parameters:  "ord_func" ->
    "S_ord_func", "reverse_order_of_singles" -> "S_is_reverse_order",
    "treat_Nothing_as_max" -> "N_is_after_all_S".

    * (Array.pod)  Added new ord-det function "sys.std.Core.Array.order",
    which provides the canonical means to order 2 Array, or 2 String; it
    forms the basis for ordering functions of Blob, Text, NameChain, etc.

    * (Cast.pod)  Updated the type "PInt2_36" to change its default value
    to 10 from 2, to correspond to base-10 being the default base for
    numeric literals in the STD dialects when no explicit base is given;
    also updated all 4 functions which have a param of that type to make
    that param optional, as each one will default to 10 if no arg is given.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Muldis D now incorporates Unicode
    5.2.0 rather than the 5.1.0 version.

    * (Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod,
    PTMD_STD.pod, Changes, TODO)  Fixed all misspellings of 'analogous'.

    * (Types.pod, Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Scalar.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In a reversal of one aspect of release 0.61.0,
    brought back the concept of scalar types that have zero possreps and
    hence are primitive types; however, now only "Int" is a primitive
    scalar type, and all other scalar types including "String" are still
    not; also removed the cludge concept of a type being defined as a union
    over an infinite number of singleton types, which "Int" had used but no
    longer does; this all is just a refactor, and the semantics of "Int"
    are unchanged.  In Types.pod, changed the definition of the "Int" type
    to say it is now an infinite-cardinality primitive type with no
    possreps rather than say it is an enumerated type over an infinite
    number of singleton "Int.*" types, and also deleted said infinite
    "Int.*" types.  In Basics.pod, updated a few paragraphs in the "TYPE
    SYSTEM" main pod section or its subsections so they now say that "Int"
    is the third primitive type (besides "Tuple" and "Relation"), and added
    mentions that the special "Int" can have no possreps, and removed any
    references to the "Int.*" types.  In Types_Catalog.pod and Scalar.pod,
    updated a few description paragraphs likewise.  In all 3 STD.pod files,
    updated the "Scalar" expression node kind to specify it can't any more
    be used to select "Int" values, but just all other scalar values, and
    updated the "the_floor" catalog abstraction level to also allow use of
    "Int" as a "value" node in addition to the 3 "Scalar", "Tuple",
    "Relation" of before; also updated any example Muldis D code that had
    used a "Scalar" node to select an "Int" value to use an "Int" node
    instead; this example code was all in the "the_floor" pod sub-section,
    which was made an order of magnitude less verbose as a result.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl5_STD.pod)  Small amount of grammar
    normalization where any non-alphanumeric grammar characters intended to
    be matched literally are now written string-quoted rather than
    backslashed; for example, [\^] was changed to ['^']; all of the changes
    concerned the formats of integer or rational value literals.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Made the "if_else_expr" grammar node kind stricter
    such that a minimum of 1 "if_expr"+"then_expr" element is needed rather
    than zero being allowed.  But the corresponding system catalog values
    and Perl-STD grammar nodes still allow zero elements.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  The grammar now uses "<ws>" and "<ws>?" rather than
    "\s+" and "\s*" to define whitespace rules of Muldis D code, and
    moreover the meaning of "<ws>" is defined by Muldis D rather than using
    Perl 6's definition, such that our "<ws>" has a stricter definition
    that just includes the 5 ASCII characters SPACE and [\t\n\f\r].  This
    means that, for now, Unicode linebreaks and other kinds of whitespace
    aren't allowed literally outside of character string literals.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, D.pm)  Refactored the grammar
    for the 2 fully-qualified Muldis D language name elements
    "ln_base_authority", "ln_base_version_number" so that they are no
    longer defined as having the same format as a "Name" payload, but
    rather they are independently defined, so they can evolve separately.
    Now these 2 "ln" parts (and hence all language-name parts) are more
    strict in that they must be nonempty strings and they are expressly
    limited to using non-control characters in the ASCII repertoire,
    instead of being allowed any Unicode chars.  But in PTMD_STD, the
    bareword format of the 2 parts now has fewer limitations than a
    bareword "Name", in that it may have periods and it may start with
    digits; therefore, updated all example code of Muldis D language names
    so that the version-number portion is no longer delimited.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Made the nonquoted "Name" literals format more
    restrictive so it only allows ASCII chars, and not anything else that
    Unicode considers an alphanumeric.  Technically speaking, the actual
    grammar is unchanged, but rather the associated documentation saying it
    should be expanded to include Unicode alphanums was removed/replaced.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the 2 pod sub-sections "Simple Non-symmetric
    Dyadic Infix Operators" and "Order Comparison Operators", concerning
    the existing alternate syntaxes for 24 functions that test set
    membership or sub/superset relationships, so that plain ASCII infix
    syntax alternatives are now provided, and not just infix syntax options
    that use trans-ASCII Unicode characters.  All of the additional options
    are alpha rather than symbolic, such as "imem" for "∈".  As a result of
    this update, now one can use all features of the 3 STD dialects without
    touching any non-ASCII Unicode characters, besides the Unicode support.
    Also, for the 2 operators "I∈" and "I∉", added the additional aliases
    "between" and "!between"|"not-between", respectively.

    * (Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod, Bag.pod, Interval.pod)  Updated
    the also-known-as notes for 24 functions in correspondence to
    above-mentioned changes.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Fixed 3 instances of a grammar typo.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added new mandatory pragma
    "op_char_repertoire" that determines whether or not the various routine
    invocation alternate syntaxes (and a few special value literals) may be
    composed of only ASCII characters or also other Unicode characters.
    Code specifying "basic" for the new pragma can only use ASCII chars
    outside delimited character strings and should work on minimal Muldis D
    implementations and older text editors, while code specifying
    "extended" can use all the defined canonical symbols for math or logic
    or relational et al operations as recognized in the wider world, rather
    than just approximations.  Updated the main pod section "LANGUAGE NAME"
    and added the new main pod section "OPERATOR CHARACTER REPERTOIRE"
    (located just following "CATALOG ABSTRACTION LEVELS").  Updated all
    code examples with a "language name" to add uses of the new pragma.  In
    PTMD_STD.pod, each of the 2 op char repertoires has its own definition
    for the 9 grammar nodes "Bool_payload", "maybe_Nothing",
    "comm_infix_reduce_op", "[|non]sym_dyadic_infix_op",
    "monadic_prefix_op", "is_[before|after]_op", "interval_membership_op";
    this is the semi-formal way in which the effects of each level on the
    grammar are specified.  In the various pod sub-sections of PTMD_STD.pod
    that declare said 9 (now refactored / split in 2) grammar nodes,
    reorganized the various doc tables (saying what keywords are aliases or
    what functions they invoke) so that ASCII versions are now consistently
    favored over other Unicode versions as the "main" versions, rather than
    sometimes ASCII and sometimes Unicode; but, where 3 or more versions of
    the same operator exist, a Unicode version is always in 2nd place and
    favored over all but the single main ASCII version; all code examples
    in these sub-sections were left unchanged, some using Unicode.

    * Update TODO file with draft outline on some grammar/etc changes that
    would add support for different charsets in delimited char strings,
    especially Unicode compatibility vs canonical, which when used for
    identifiers could help avoid some security problems.

    * Muldis::D version 0.109.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.109.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a refactor of the root of the scalar type
    composition hierarchy so that now how it is actually structured is a
    better reflection of how it was conceptually structured before.  To be
    specific, "Int" replaces "String" as that 1 special type which is
    defined as an enumeration union type over an infinite number of
    singleton types.  "String" was conceptually a dense sequence of "Int"
    and now it actually is one; "String" is now nonscalar, an
    "array_of.Int", and "Int" no longer has a possrep defined over a
    single-element-"String"-typed attribute.  One of the many benefits of
    this change is that we will no longer need to add a bunch of
    "String"-specific functions to bootstrap the system scalar type
    definitions; we can now just use the Int or Array functions instead.

    * (Types.pod)  Refactored the "Int" type by splitting that into itself
    plus an infinite number of "Int.*" singleton types, where the former is
    defined as a union over the latter.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Refactored the infinite scalar "String[|.*]"
    types by merging them into the single nonscalar "String" type which is
    defined simply as a proper subtype of "DHArray" with "Int" elements.
    Also deleted the "SEString" subtype which has no more uses now that
    "Int" isn't defined over "String".  The other 3 subtypes
    "[B|O|UCP]String" still exist and are unchanged from before aside from
    becoming "Array" subtypes as with "String"; all scalar types besides
    "Int" that composed a "String" subtype still do, meaning "Blob" and
    "Text".  Split the main pod section "SIMPLE GENERIC SCALAR TYPES" into
    itself plus the new main pod section "SIMPLE GENERIC STRING TYPES"; the
    latter got all 4 of the "String" types (that are no longer scalar) and
    the former kept all the other types.  Also updated the def of the
    "OVLScalar" union type to exclude "String", which is no longer scalar.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the few references that said
    "String" was special and changed them to say "Int" instead, and
    otherwise updated any references to those 2 types as appropriate.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Completely removed the value
    literal syntax specific to the "String" type (that being the "String"
    value node kind), and the whole "Low Level Integer String Literals" pod
    sub-section along with it.  If one still has a reason to write plain
    "String" literals that aren't by way of the "Blob" or "Text" syntax,
    then an ordinary "Array" literal with "Int" elements is typically just
    as concise as the old "String" literals were.  Also updated all code
    examples, that had used nestings of the generic "Scalar" value literal
    syntax to select "Int" or "Text" values in terms of the singleton
    "String" types, to instead either use the new "Int" singletons straight
    out or use those with "Array" or "Relation" literals to select the
    "Text".  These examples were all in 2 places, the "Scalar Selectors"
    pod sub-section and especially the "the_floor" pod sub-section.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  In the "General Purpose Integer Numeric Literals" pod
    sub-section, cleaned the grammar to remove unnecessary square brackets.

2010-01-24  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.108.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.108.0.tar.gz.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  This release features a significant
    change to how explicit (not as-an-updater) transactions are defined and
    conceived.  Before, an explicit transaction was tied to a "try-catch"
    control-flow statement and the transaction encompassed the procedure
    invoked as the "try", and the same procedure could also be invoked
    non-transactionally (outside a "try-catch").  Now, an explicit
    transaction is instead tied to a procedure definition itself, meaning
    that all invocations of that procedure, whether through a "try-catch"
    or not, are now transactional.  This change means that all (lexically
    scoped) transactions are now be treated the same, as being attached
    just to the definition of the routine whose actions they compose, and
    an invoker doesn't have to invoke an updater or procedure differently
    in that respect to make it a transaction.  Now, a "try" is only used as
    with traditional languages, in that it just catches exceptions and it
    doesn't define transaction scopes.  All this being said, the other
    fundamentals for transactions in Muldis D are unchanged; terminating a
    routine abnormally with a thrown exception is the *only* way to make a
    transaction associated with the routine's scope to rollback; it commits
    otherwise.  In Basics.pod, updated the "TRANSACTIONS AND CONCURRENCY"
    main pod section and the "Functions, Updaters, and Procedures" pod
    sub-section of "ROUTINES".  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the
    "Procedure" catalog type to add a 9th attribute "is_transaction"; also
    updated the description of the "try" attribute of the
    "TryCatchStmtNodeSet" catalog type.

    * (Integer.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  Renamed the 2 functions
    "sys.std.Core.Integer.[in|de]c" to "succ|pred" (succeeding|preceding).

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Typo fix.

    * Update TODO file with draft outline on some type system changes that
    would add mixins/interfaces/etc, and for some transaction handling
    changes that make a DBMS multi-versioned fundamentally.

2010-01-16  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.107.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.107.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a change in the canonical way to represent the
    kind of data types that would conventionally be called "enumerated
    types" in the industry, where examples are the system-defined types
    "Bool", "Order", "RatRoundMeth".  The old canonical way was for each
    "enumerated type" to be a scalar structure type with a single main/only
    possrep with a single "Name"-typed attribute whose allowed values are
    restricted to a pre-defined set.  The new canonical way is for each
    "enumerated type" to be declared as a scalar union type over a set of
    singleton scalar types (each with a single possrep with zero
    attributes), with one singleton type per pre-defined value.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod,
    Basics.pod, Conventions.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod,
    Blob.pod, Bool.pod, Interval.pod, Relation.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod,
    STDIO.pod, Scalar.pod, Set.pod, Text.pod, Tuple.pod, Universal.pod,
    Counted.pod, DateTime.pod)  Renamed all of the "simple enumeration"
    structure data type values, and the other named singleton values, so
    that their words are capitalized rather than lowercase, and lack
    underscore separators where they had them before.  Both the applicable
    scalar attribute values, and the literal-keywords in all dialects, were
    updated.  These 12 scalar values/keywords are the result of said
    renaming: "Bool:[False|True]", "Order:[Increase|Same|Decrease]",
    "RatRoundRule:[Half[Down|Up|Even]|To[Floor|Ceiling|Zero|Inf]".  These 4
    nonscalar values/keywords are the result of said renaming: "Tuple:D0",
    "Relation:D0C[0|1]", "Maybe:Nothing".  The relevant type definition
    updates were in Types.pod (Bool) and Types_Catalog.pod (Order,
    RatRoundRule).  The relevant literal-keyword updates were in all 3
    STD.pod, and to a lesser extent in Types.pod and Basics.pod.  In a few
    places there were capitalization changes to some routine names or
    routine parameter names, concerning the 4 nonscalar values.  All other
    files updated in this change item are mainly referential updates.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the catalog type "DomainType" to add an
    optional-use 8th attribute "order" which functions as per that
    attribute of "ScalarType"; this is intended to support enum types that
    are defined as a union of singletons to have a built-in values order.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  In
    Types.pod, refactored the 1 type "Bool" into 3 types which are itself
    plus the 2 "Bool.True", "Bool.False" where the latter 2 are singleton
    types and the former is defined as a union over them.  In
    Types_Catalog.pod, likewise refactored the 2 types "Order" and
    "RatRoundMeth" into 4 types and 8 types, respectively.  In Basics.pod,
    in the "TYPE SYSTEM" main pod section, brought up to date any
    references to whether the 3 refactored types are are considered
    structure or enumerated types.  In PTMD_STD.pod, updated the
    descriptions of the 3 node kinds "Bool", "Order", "RatRoundMeth" to
    remain compatible with refactor about how payloads map to values.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the "Interval
    Selectors" pod sub-section to add special shorthand syntax for
    singleton (single-value) interval-parts, so that the identical
    endpoints can be specified once (eg, "{6}") rather than twice (eg,
    {6..6}).  This feature was previously in release 0.105.0 for PTMD_STD
    only, but removed in 0.106.0; now this feature's in all 3 STD dialects.

2010-01-07  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.106.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.106.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a re-do of release 0.105.0 with respect to just
    the changes it made concerning interval types; all other aspects of the
    language spec are untouched.  The primary change items of release
    0.106.0 are in 2 groups, the first group which restores the state of
    intervals to that of release 0.104.0, and the second group re-adds
    support for multiple-part unions in a different manner.

    * (Types.pod)  Updated the descriptions of the 3 types
    "DH[Set|Array|Bag].T" to specify that they are intersection types.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Basics.pod,
    Types.pod, Universal.pod, Relation.pod, Interval.pod)  Fixed several
    instances of typos where "a" should be "an" or vice-versa.

    * (Interval.pod)  Updated the "NAME" pod to say "Muldis D generic
    interval operators" rather than "Muldis D Interval specific operators"
    and updated the "DESCRIPTION" pod similarly.

    * (Universal.pod)  Corrected a fossil, left over from the changes in
    version 0.101.0, where the paragraph talking about intervals should
    never have been copied from Ordered.pod to Universal.pod, since the
    functions it described went to Interval.pod instead.

    * (Types.pod, Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  This change item reverts all the material
    interval-concerning changes of release 0.105.0 so that that subsequent
    change items can re-add those changes in a different manner.  In
    Types.pod, removed the 2 core relation types "[|DH]IntervalUnion".  In
    Basics.pod, updated the "Referencing Data Types" pod sub-section so it
    is once again implied that the "[|dh_]interval_of" prefix declares
    "Interval" types as in 0.104.0; also updated the "NOTES ON TERMINOLOGY"
    main pod section to remove the glossary item "interval, interval-union,
    non-union interval".  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the
    "IvlSelExprNodeSet" catalog type to rename its "elems" attribute to
    "interval", and otherwise reverted its description.  In all 3 STD.pod,
    updated the "Interval Selectors" pod sub-section to revert all of its
    details to release-0.104.0-state, including that "Interval" nodes now
    select "Interval" values again, and removed its newest 3 code examples.
    In PTMD_STD.pod, removed the shorthand for single-elem interval values;
    this specific feature is *not* being brought back as part of the re-do.
    Following these reversions, all Muldis D routines, types, syntax that
    uses intervals now again uses exclusively "Interval" or its subtypes.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod,
    Basics.pod, Interval.pod, Array.pod, Relation.pod, Integer.pod,
    Rational.pod)  Renamed the plain "interval" concept to the more
    descriptive "single-piece interval", which affects several areas of the
    Muldis D syntax but has no impact on its semantics.  In Types.pod,
    renamed the 2 core types "[|DH]Interval" to "[|DH]SPInterval".  In
    Types_Catalog.pod, renamed the catalog type "IvlSelExprNodeSet" to
    "SPIvlSelExprNodeSet", and updated the catalog type "ExprNodeSet" to
    rename its "ivl_sel_exprs" attribute to "sp_ivl_sel_exprs".  In all 3
    STD.pod, renamed the "Interval" value node kind to "SPInterval".  In
    Basics.pod, updated the "Referencing Data Types" pod sub-section to
    rename the prefix "[|dh_]interval_of" to "[|dh_]sp_interval_of".  In
    all relevant files, updated any references to the old names to instead
    use the new names.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod,
    Basics.pod)  Expanded the generic parameterizable interval types core
    feature so that multi-piece intervals (such as {1..3,6..6,8..9}) are
    supported, not just single-piece intervals (such as {1..10}).  In
    Types.pod, added the 2 new core types "[|DH]MPInterval" which are
    relation types defined partly in terms of the 2 tuple types
    "[|DH]SPInterval", where they have the same nonscalar headings, and add
    no constraints; also, the canonical empty interval value is now the
    relation with zero tuples rather than a single tuple with min before
    max.  In Types_Catalog.pod, added new catalog type
    "MPIvlSelExprNodeSet" that corresponds directly to
    "SPIvlSelExprNodeSet" (it selects multi-piece rather than single-piece
    intervals) but its payload attribute is named "elems" (such as the
    set|ary|bag-sel types have) rather than "interval".  Also updated the
    catalog type "ExprNodeSet" to add a 14th attribute "mp_ivl_sel_exprs"
    of the new catalog type.  In all 3 STD.pod, updated primarily the
    "Interval Selectors" pod sub-section to added new value node kind
    "MPInterval", which is similar to "SPInterval" but that takes a list of
    interval specifiers rather than exactly one.  Also added 3 "MPInterval"
    code examples to each STD file under "Interval Selectors".  In
    Basics.pod, updated the "Referencing Data Types" pod sub-section to add
    the prefix "[|dh_]mp_interval_of".  For now all of this new multi-piece
    intervals support is just declared and can be used by users, but no
    other parts of the language itself use the features yet.

    * Muldis::D version 0.105.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.105.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features some significant changes to the way that
    nonscalar types are declared and referenced.  Previously, the only
    facility to declare a nonscalar type mainly in terms of an attribute
    list, as a "NonscalarType" material, was limited in that it could only
    declare 2 new data types at once, a tuple type and relation type with
    matching headings, rather than just 1 of those.  In order to reference
    either of the 2 data types individually, it was generally required to
    use a "type.tuple_from." or "type.relation_from." prefix in the
    reference; if the material was referenced without either prefix as a
    type, then it was either the tuple type or relation type referenced,
    depending on how the material was defined.  This whole state of affairs
    tended to make some things more complicated than they ought to have
    been, even if it was meant to prevent some other complications; but
    thanks to groundwork laid by some previous releases, this situation has
    now been reversed as the alternate state of affairs is no longer so
    troublesome.  And so now, the "NonscalarType" material kind has been
    split up into the 2 new material kinds "TupleType" and "RelationType",
    where each one declares exactly 1 data type as is otherwise normal, and
    the "from" prefixes no longer exist in their prior forms.  Following
    the refactor, to declare a tuple type it is done simply as one might
    expect.  But to declare a relation type, it is now mandatory to also
    explicitly declare a tuple type over which the relation type is partly
    directly defined.  A tuple type declaration specifies the nonscalar
    heading and the per-each-tuple constraints (plus other details), while
    a relation type declaration adds per-whole-relation constraints and
    (unique) key constraints.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Split the 1 "NonscalarType" catalog type, which
    had 13 attributes, into the 2 "[Tuple|Relation]Type", which have 9 and
    6 attributes respectively.  Both of the new types got a copy of these 2
    old attrs: "comment", "base_type".  The 1 old attr "is_tuple_first" is
    simply gone, and just "RelationType" has the 1 new attr "tuple_type".
    Only "TupleType" has a copy of these 7 attrs: "attrs",
    "virtual_attr_maps", "tuple_constraints" (renamed to "constraints"),
    "distrib_keys", "[|distrib_]subset_constraints", "default_tuple"
    (renamed to "default").  Only "RelationType" has a copy of these 3
    attrs: "relation_constraints" (renamed to "constraints"), "keys",
    "default_relation" (renamed to "default").  Also split the 2 catalog
    types "[|Sys]NonscalarTypeSet" into the 4
    "[|Sys][Tuple|Relation]TypeSet" where each new one is a clone of its
    original save for its name.  Also updated each of the 2 catalog types
    "System", "Depot" to split its "nonscalar_types" attribute into the 2
    "[tuple|relation]_types".

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Split the 2 catalog recipes
    "[create|drop]_nonscalar_type" into the 4 recipes
    "[create|drop]_[tuple|relation]_type".

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  In Types.pod, added the 6 new tuple
    types "sys.std.Core.Type.[|DH][Set|Array|Bag].T", each of which exists
    in order for the corresponding-named relation type to be defined partly
    in terms of it.  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the "DESCRIPTION" main
    pod section to add a note that for every relation type defined in that
    file there is also a corresponding tuple type, but those tuple types
    are not yet explicitly defined (its TODO later).

    * (Basics.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  In Basics.pod, updated the "Referencing
    Data Types" pod sub-section of "ENTITY NAMES" to remove any references
    to the "[|dh_]relation_from." prefixes, leaving only the
    "[|dh_]tuple_from." prefixes, and rewrote the associated rationale
    text.  In PTMD_STD.pod, updated one sentence of the "DBMS Entity Name
    Literals" pod sub-section concerning the same thing.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Split the "Nonscalar Type
    Specification" placeholder pod sub-section into the 2 "[Tuple|Relation]
    Type Specification" and split the "nonscalar_type" material node kind
    into the 2 "[tuple|relation]_type".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Renamed the type generator called "union type"
    to "domain type" so to better describe what the generator actually
    does; it can define types not only as type unions but also type
    intersections|differences|etc.  In Types_Catalog.pod, renamed the
    catalog type "UnionType" to "DomainType", and renamed the 2 catalog
    types "[|Sys]UnionTypeSet" to "[|Sys]DomainTypeSet", and updated each
    of the 2 catalog types "System", "Depot" to rename its "union_types"
    attribute to "domain_types".  In Routines_Catalog.pod, renamed the 2
    recipes "[create|drop]_union_type" to "[create|drop]_domain_type".  In
    all 3 STD.pod, renamed the "Union Type Specification" pod sub-section
    to "Domain Type Specification" and renamed the "union_type" material
    node kind to "domain_type".

    * (Types.pod)  Fix indenting under "TYPE SUMMARY"; the "Interval" type
    is a "Tuple" not a "DHTuple".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Corrected several instances of a fossil, left
    over from the changes in version 0.90.0, where uses of the term
    "declared name" should have been changed to "invocation name".  Also
    corrected several instances of a fossil, left over from the changes in
    version 0.81.0, where uses of the phrase "type whose declaration it is
    part of" should have been changed to "type being defined".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Fixed several instances
    of fossil-typos where "a" should be "an" or vice-versa.

    * (HDMD_Perl6_STD.pod)  Modified a few code examples to use more of the
    ":foo<bar>" Perl 6 syntax rather than ":foo('bar')" where it works.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the "DBMS Entity Name Literals" pod
    sub-section regarding abbreviated references to system-defined entities
    so to clarify that any trailing empty-string chain elements of the
    entity names are ignored when determining a match for an abbreviated
    reference; the behaviour is similar to how fully-qualified references
    don't need trailing empty-string chain elements either.

    * (Conventions.pod)  Added a couple paragraphs to the "Entity Naming"
    pod sub-section concerning relative naming of tuple and relation types.

    * (Types.pod, Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Expanded the generic parameterizable interval
    types core feature so that interval-unions (such as {1..3,6..6,8..9})
    are supported, not just (non-union) intervals (such as {1..10}).  In
    Types.pod, added the 2 new core types "[|DH]IntervalUnion" which are
    relation types defined partly in terms of the 2 tuple types
    "[|DH]Interval", where they have the same nonscalar headings, and add
    no constraints; also, the canonical empty interval-union value is now
    the relation with zero tuples rather than a single tuple with min
    before max.  In Basics.pod, updated the "Referencing Data Types" pod
    sub-section to declare that the "[|dh_]interval_of" prefix now actually
    declares interval-union types, not (non-union) intervals as before.
    Also updated the "NOTES ON TERMINOLOGY" main pod section to add the
    glossary item "interval, interval-union, non-union interval" which
    explains how now the unqualified term "interval" may actually mean
    "interval-union".  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the
    "IvlSelExprNodeSet" catalog type to rename its "interval" attribute to
    "elems", such as the set|ary|bag-sel types have, and update its
    description to specify it selects interval-unions.  In all 3 STD.pod,
    updated the "Interval Selectors" pod sub-section to specify that
    "Interval" nodes now select "IntervalUnion" values rather than
    "Interval" values, and to expand what literal formats an "Interval"
    node payload may be; generally the new payload format is a list each of
    whose elements is what the old payload was; but for the most part a
    whole payload may alternately be just what an element would otherwise
    be, which maintains backwards compatibility with old Muldis D code.  To
    be specific, both PTMD_STD and HDMD_Perl6_STD have complete backwards
    compatibility while HDMD_Perl5_STD has backwards compatibility only
    where the old "min" or "max" expression node values weren't expressed
    as Perl array refs, such as would be the case with temporal intervals
    but not generally with numbers or text.  Also added 3 more code
    examples to each STD file under "Interval Selectors".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Added special shorthand syntax for non-union
    intervals, that consisted of a single value, of interval-union
    literals, so that the single non-union interval's value could be
    specified once (eg, "{6}") rather than twice (eg, {6..6}).

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2010.

    * Muldis::D version 0.104.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.104.0.tar.gz.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Fixed a few search+replace errors that
    release 0.96.1 introduced.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Corrected a few pod formatting errors.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Refactored the name-chain catalog types and
    their corresponding literal syntax, to make some design simplifications
    while maintaining the existing level of functionality.  In
    Types_Catalog.pod, renamed the "NameChain" type to "PNSQNameChain"
    (parent namespace qualified) and the "DeclNameChain" type to
    "NameChain", and then merged the 2 types to make the new
    "PNSQNameChain" a proper subtype of the new "NameChain" rather than a
    disjoint type, and "PNSQNameChain" now has a different default value;
    the 2 types' definitions are otherwise unchanged.  In all 5 files,
    updated any references to these types to use their new names.  In
    Types_Catalog.pod, renamed the "NameDNCMap" type to "NameNCMap" and
    renamed its "dnc" attribute to "nc"; also updated any refs to use the
    new names.  In all 3 STD files, renamed the "NameChain" node kind to
    "PNSQNameChain" and the "DeclNameChain" node kind to "NameChain"; now,
    both node kinds can be used as literals for "NameChain" values, and
    they mainly differ in that the new "PNSQNameChain" supports all the
    various special shorthands for name chains while the new "NameChain"
    supports no shorthands at all.  The end result of these changes for
    writing Muldis D code is that GCVLs denoting name-chain values have
    changes to their "node kind" while SCVLs (most uses) have no changes.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)
    In Basics.pod, updated the "ENTITY NAMES" main pod section and its
    "User-Defined Entities" subsection to add the new primary namespace
    "rtn", which refers to the lexically innermost routine, and its use
    should make it easier to write directly-recursive routines, especially
    routines that are written as anonymous routines, where the name of that
    routine is chosen automatically by the compiler rather than explicitly
    by the programmer.  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the catalog type
    "PNSQNameChain" and its appropriate subtypes to include the "rtn"
    chain; also updated the desc of the "namespaces" attr of the "System"
    catalog type to add "rtn".  In PTMD_STD.pod, added refs to "rtn" in the
    "PNSQNameChain" node kind desc.  In all 3 STD files, added a code
    example of invoking a function using its "rtn" name-alias.

    * Updated the TODO file with the broad criteria for moving the dev
    status of the Muldis D spec from its current "pre-alpha" to "alpha",
    and broad further criteria for moving it to "beta" or above.

2009-12-20  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.103.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.103.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  A procedure may now directly invoke a function,
    rather than needing the contrivance of an updater intermediary when it
    conceptually wants to do this.  However, a procedure still may not
    directly have any expression trees; a procedure's function invocation
    is directly bound to a list of variables, for the function's arguments
    to come directly from its or result to go directly to.  An interesting
    consequence of this change is that now users may write a large amount
    of their Muldis D code procedurally rather than functionally (not that
    this is generally a good idea), where each function invocation that
    they do have is sequenced in time between the others, except that they
    still need functions when invoking system-defined routines that take
    functions as arguments, not that those always need to be used.  Added
    new catalog type "FuncInvoStmtNodeSet", and updated the catalog type
    "StmtNodeSet" to add a new attribute "func_invo_stmts" of the new type.
    Also updated the descriptions of the "OVLScaValStmtNodeSet" and
    "APMaterialNCSelStmtNodeSet" catalog types.  Also fixed a few fossils
    where the "IISArgVarMap" type is used.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod,
    Conventions.pod)  Converted the try-catch control flow construct from a
    generic procedure to its own procedure statement kind.  This was done
    partly to support the language being simplified in other ways, such as
    to remove features that weren't really being used except by the old
    "try_catch" procedure.  In Types_Catalog.pod, added new catalog type
    "TryCatchStmtNodeSet", and updated the catalog type "StmtNodeSet" to
    add a new attribute "try_catch_stmts" of the new type.  In
    Routines_Catalog.pod, removed the "try_catch" procedure.  In
    Basics.pod, changed any references to the removed procedure to refer to
    the new statement kind.  In Conventions.pod, a small related change.

    * (Basics.pod)  Rewrote or otherwise reorganized about 2/3 of the
    "ROUTINES" main pod section (including all its sub-sections) to bring
    it more up to date, make it easier to understand, and to add more
    information.  Rather than having a separate pod sub-section for each
    routine kind, the information on the kinds is spread out over multiple
    sections that organize more on feature topics, or separate fundamentals
    from special cases.  The "ROUTINES" main description plus the 4
    sub-sections "function", "updater", "procedure", "Other Matters" were
    about 90% rewritten as a new main description plus the 3 sub-sections
    "Functions, Updaters, and Procedures", "Emphasis on Purity", "More on
    Parameters".  The 10 sub-sections "[type|state|transition]-constraint",
    "named-value", "[possrep|virtual-attr]-map", "order-determination",
    "value-filter", "value-map", "value-reduction" were reorganized and
    about 20% rewritten into the 2 sub-sections "Kinds of Functions by
    Structure", "[Constraint|Other] Function Kinds by Purpose"; in the
    process, also added the 2 new function kinds "value-map-unary",
    "value-constraint", which serve to organize some of the other special
    kinds; "value-constraint" names the structure that
    "[type|state]-constraint" both have, and "value-map-unary" does that
    for both of "[possrep|virtual-attr]-map"; it was also formalized that
    "value-filter" is a (more specialized) "value-map".  The 1 sub-section
    "system-service" was renamed and 10% rewritten into the 1 sub-section
    "Kinds of Procedures"; in the process, redefined one nature of
    "system-service" so that now it *is* a procedure rather than being a
    4th main kind of routine (not one of func|upd|proc); this also now
    means that users can define "system-service" routines too, rather than
    those being restricted for being built-ins.  For all intents and
    purposes, this change item made no material change to the Muldis D
    language, but simply reorganized how the existing design is explained.

    * (Basics.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod)  In Basics.pod, added a new
    procedure kind named "recipe" which is restricted to be deterministic
    and is automatically a serialized-isolation transaction; it is intended
    mainly for defining routines that conceptually do both data-definition
    and data-manipulation as an atomic unit, since those two actions can't
    actually happen simultaneously.  In Routines_Catalog.pod, updated all
    of the routine signatures that used to be "procedure", except for the 1
    "proc_invo", so they are now "recipe" instead.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod)  In Types_Catalog.pod, added 8 new
    catalog types that are all proper subtypes of "Function":
    "[NamedVal|ValMap[|U]|ValFilt|[Val|Trans]Constr|ValRed|OrdDet]Func";
    each of these corresponds to one of the 8 similary-named function kinds
    named in Basics.pod that can be easily distinguished by its structure
    (number or names of function parameters or function result declared
    types).  Also reordered the "CurriedFuncNC" subtype declarations so
    they match the order of the new catalog types they correspond to.  In
    Basics.pod, updated the "Kinds of Functions by Structure" pod
    sub-section to add references to the 8 new catalog types.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod)  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the
    catalog type "Procedure" to add the 2 new boolean attributes
    "is_recipe", "is_system_service"; when one is true (they default to
    false) then the procedure is explicitly declared to be that kind of
    procedure.  Also added 2 new catalog types that are all proper subtypes
    of "Procedure": "Recipe", "SystemService"; each of these corresponds to
    one of the 2 similary-named procedure kinds named in Basics.pod.  In
    Basics.pod, updated the "Kinds of Procedures" pod sub-section to add
    references to the 2 new catalog types.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  In the "Material Specification Common Elements" pod
    sub-section, updated the "material_kind" node kind to replace the 10
    old named function kinds with the 8 new ones distinguishable by
    structure, and added the 2 named procedure kinds.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the DESCRIPTION main
    pod section to use the current Muldis D version number in the
    fully-qualified name of the dialect rather than "N.N.N", and updated
    all code examples that declare a language name to use the current
    version rather than "1.2.3".  If there is still a good reason to do
    differently than this, these changes might be reverted in the future.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added new pragma
    "standard_syntax_extensions" (SSE) that declares which optional
    portions of the Muldis D grammar a programmer may employ with their
    Muldis D code; the value for the new pragma is a set/list of SSE to
    activate; the pragma is optional to specify and defaults to the empty
    set (meaning core syntax only).  Updated the main pod section "LANGUAGE
    NAME" and added the new main pod section "STANDARD SYNTAX EXTENSIONS"
    (located just following "CATALOG ABSTRACTION LEVELS").

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Refactored the syntax for
    opaque value literals of the UTC/float date and time types of the
    DateTime.pod language extension so that this syntax now constitutes a
    new "date_time" standard syntax extension.  And so the core standard
    syntax now only includes support for types and routines that are part
    of the Muldis D language core; supporting special syntax for non-core
    types or routines is now optional.  Added new pod sub section of
    "STANDARD SYNTAX EXTENSIONS" named "date_time" and added new pod main
    section "DATE-TIME EXTENSION OPAQUE VALUE LITERALS" (located just prior
    to "NESTING PRECEDENCE RULES").  Moved the pod sub-section "UTC and
    Float Temporal Literals" into the new main section and renamed it to
    "Date and Time Literals".  Updated the main pod section "VALUE LITERALS
    AND SELECTORS" to move the 3 OVL node kinds "UTCInstant",
    "FloatInstant", "UTCDuration" from there to the new "DATE-TIME ..."
    main section.  In the future, "DATE-TIME ..." may be expanded to have
    more or better value literal syntax for DateTime.pod types, or have
    special syntax for DateTime.pod routines.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Corrected several instances of a fossil, left over
    from the changes in version 0.79.0, where several uses of the
    "Tuple_payload" grammar node should have been changed to "tuple_list".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Added special shorthand syntax for name-expr pairs,
    that may be used only if the "expr" is simply the name of a lexical
    data element (expr node or param or var) and the name of that element
    is identical to the "name" of the pair, and lets you specify the
    identical name just once.  For example, "foo => $foo" may alternately
    be written as "$>foo", which has the exact same semantics.  The 2 main
    parts of the grammar this affects is the attr-expr pairs in tuple or
    relation or scalar literals, and param-expr pairs in routine calls.
    The HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD dialects have no corresponding shorthand, since
    there a set of name-value pairs are usually specified with a Perl Hash.
    All corresponding grammar or description updates, and sample code
    additions so far are in these 2 pod sub-sections: "Tuple Selectors",
    "Generic Function Invocation Expressions".  Also updated relevant code
    seen in "FUNCTION INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS" subsections.

    * (Bool.pod)  The conceptual "proposition" operation is now also known
    as "so", since that complements "not" like "negation" complements the
    longer term (idea from Perl 6 spec update on 2009.12.17).

    * Reorganized the TODO file with item groupings by broad subject.

2009-11-30  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.102.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.102.0.tar.gz.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)
    In a reversal of one aspect of release 0.57.0, temporarily removed the
    language concept of "topic namespaces".  This change was made so that
    some other language changes would be easier do.  The concept of "topic
    namespaces" will likely return in a future release, if other language
    developments haven't made it redundant.  In Basics.pod, updated the
    "ENTITY NAMES" main pod section to remove the primary namespace "tpc"
    ("topic"), and removed the whole pod sub-section "Time-Varying Topic
    Namespaces".  In Types_Catalog.pod, removed the catalog type
    "TopicNSControlCat" (for "tpc.cat") plus the then-empty main pod
    section "TYPES FOR DEFINING TOPIC NAMESPACE CONTROLS"; also updated the
    description of the "namespaces" attribute of the "System" catalog type.
    In Routines_Catalog.pod, removed the procedure
    "select_topic_namespaces" plus the then-empty pod sub-section
    "Procedures For Defining Topic Namespaces"; also updated the previously
    existing 16 "create|drop" procedures for in-depot namespaces and
    routines and types so they now have the explicit 2 parent
    namespace-specifying parameters "depot" and "parent|subdepot".  In
    PTMD_STD.pod, updated the "DBMS Entity Name Literals" pod sub-section
    to remove all references to the "tpc" top-level namespace.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Simplified the "FedTypeMapSet" catalog type by
    renaming its "map" attribute to "types" and retyping the attribute from
    a "FedTypeMap" binary relation (that named type was then removed) to an
    equivalent "set_of.NameChain".

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Replaced the 2 top-level entity namespaces
    "dep" (depot) and "sdp" (subdepot) with the 1 top-level namespace "nlx"
    (nonlexical).  Now, all non-lexical user-defined entities in a depot
    are referenced in just 2 ways; the "fed" top-level provides an absolute
    path and the "nlx" top-level provides a relative path.  The new "nlx"
    is more like the old "sdp" than the old "dep" in that its path starts
    in the most immediate subdepot (or depot) parent of the referencing
    entity, but unlike "sdp", "nlx" can also navigate to parent namespaces,
    and so is fully capable of referencing anything in the referencer's
    depot.  The new "nlx" avoids the limitations of the old
    quasi-absolute-path "dep|sdp" in that it still works regardless of
    which of the referencing entity's parent namespaces is mounted in a
    DBMS as a "depot"; it makes writing portable code much easier, such
    that the code itself can be invariant between storage and live
    representation.  In Basics.pod, updated the "ENTITY NAMES" main pod
    section, and its pod sub-section "User-Defined Entities", with the
    aforementioned primary namespace replacements.  In all 6 files,
    replaced any references to "dep" or "sdp" in documentation and code
    examples with "nlx" as appropriate.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Eliminated the catalog type "MaterialRef" and
    all of its 8 subtypes (and the whole "TYPES FOR SPECIAL ENTITY
    REFERENCES" main pod section), and so now the only "Reference" type
    left in Muldis D is "External".  Replacing the "MaterialRef" types, for
    purposes of passing references to materials as routine arguments or for
    implementing higher-order functions or closures, is a new set of scalar
    "NameChain" subtypes and a new set of possibly-not-dh tuple types.  For
    each of the "MaterialRef" types, all uses of it have been replaced with
    uses of generally a single new type; the replacements are as follows
    (all types have "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.\w+" names):
    "MaterialRef" -> "AbsPathMaterialNC",
    "FuncRef" -> "APFunctionNC" + "CurriedFuncNC",
    "[OrdDet|Val[Filt|Map|Red]]FuncRef" ->
        "[OrdDet|Val[Filt|Map|Red]]CFuncNC",
    "[Upd|Proc|Type]Ref" -> "AP[Updater|Procedure|Type]NC";
    also added the 3 closely related new types "MaterialNC", "APNonTypeNC",
    "RelPathMaterialNC" which are not direct replacements for
    "MaterialRef" types.  The 5 new types named "CurriedFuncNC" and
    "\w+CFuncNC" are the tuple types, and all represent a function
    reference plus 0..N prebound parameters; the other 8 new types are all
    "NameChain" subtypes and represent just a plain entity reference.  The
    5 new tuple types comprise a new main pod section named "TYPES FOR
    POSSIBLY CURRIED HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the 2 catalog types
    "MaterialRefSel[Expr|Stmt]NodeSet" to
    "APMaterialNCSel[Expr|Stmt]NodeSet" and tightened the declared types of
    each of their "referencing" parameters from "NameChain" to
    "RelPathMaterialNC"; the purpose of these catalog types has been
    modified to derive absolute path name chains from relative path
    name-chains, rather than derive opaque reference values from name
    chains.  Also updated each of the 2 catalog types "[Expr|Stmt]NodeSet"
    to rename its "material_ref_sel_[expr|stmt]s" attribute to
    "ap_material_nc_sel_[expr|stmt]s".

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Removed the "curried_func" catalog function,
    which is no longer necessary since ordinary tuple operators can be used
    instead for the same purpose.  (But a replacement function could be
    added later as a useful alternate syntax perhaps.)

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  Excised any
    references to the removed "MaterialRef" types.  In Basics.pod,
    simplified the description of the "reference" type category so that
    only the "External" type is mentioned as an example, rather than also
    the "MaterialRef" types.  In Types.pod, updated the "Reference" type to
    make its default value the same as "External" rather than the same as
    "MaterialRef".  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the description of the
    "special_types" attribute of the "System" catalog type to remove
    "MaterialRef" from its list.  In PTMD_STD.pod, substituted appropriate
    type name references in the "MATERIAL SPECIFICATION" main pod section
    and the "Library Entity Reference Selector" pod sub-section.

    * (Universal.pod, Scalar.pod, Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod,
    Array.pod, Bag.pod, Interval.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, Counted.pod)
    Updated all system defined function signatures that take material
    references or curried functions as arguments so that they take the new
    scalar/tuple types rather than the old reference types.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added these 4 catalog types that are all
    "NameChain" subtypes, for support of the next change item:
    "RPFunctionNC", "RPTypeNC", "DataNC", "LexDataNC".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  For each tuple|relation catalog type, updated
    each attribute whose declared type was "NameChain" so that it now has
    one of these 6 more restricted declared types: "MaterialNC",
    "APTypeNC", "RPFunctionNC", "RPTypeNC", "DataNC", "LexDataNC".  These 5
    attributes are now declared with "MaterialNC": "SysCatSet.catalog",
    "FuncInvoExprNodeSet.function", "MultiUpdStmt.updater",
    "UpdInvoStmtNodeSet.updater", "ProcInvoStmtNodeSet.procedure".  These 1
    attributes are now declared with "APTypeNC": "FedTypeMapSet.types".
    These 15 attributes are now declared with "RPFunctionNC":
    "ScalarType.[subtype_constraint|default|order]",
    "PossrepSet.constraint", "PossrepMapSet.[p2_from_p1|p1_from_p2]",
    "NonscalarType.[tuple|relation]_constraints",
    "NonscalarType.default_[tuple|relation]",
    "VirtualAttrMapSet.virtual_attr_map",
    "[Union|Subset]Type.[constraints|default]".  These 9 attributes are now
    declared with "RPTypeNC": "Depot.data", "Function.result_type",
    "ScaSelExprNodeSet.type_name",
    "[Scalar|Nonscalar|Subset]Type.base_type",
    "UnionType.[sources|filters]", "NameTypeMap.type".  These 7 attributes
    are now declared with "DataNC": "SysCatSet.name",
    "OVLScaValStmtNodeSet.target", "IISArgVarMap.var",
    "IfThenVarStmtMap.if", "GivenWhenDefStmtNodeSet.given",
    "WhenThenVarStmtMap.when", "APMaterialNCSelStmtNodeSet.target".  These
    1 attributes are now declared with "LexDataNC":
    "AccExprNodeSet.target".

2009-11-26  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.101.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.101.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a rough cut (that might have introduced a few
    subtle mistakes) of a mass reorganization of Muldis D system-defined
    routines, plus a few minor data types, both between what pod files they
    are described in and between what "sys.*" name-spaces they live in.  A
    majority fraction of the materials that were considered to be part of
    language "extensions" have been promoted to be part of the language
    "core" instead.  Also, the generic "Routines.pod" has been completely
    split up into type or subject specific files.  The main reason for
    these changes is to make the language design better reflect what is
    most likely to happen with actual implementations.  The old "core"
    tried to exclude too much and be too minimal, and there were a number
    of conceptual problems such as a high degree of conceptual
    inter-dependencies between what otherwise should be independent
    extensions.  The new "core" should better reflect a practical minimum
    of functionality for a programming language, and the new "extensions"
    are now more limited to the relative fringe of functionality that is
    neither required to define any part of the core and is relatively
    complicated and is relatively likely to not be easy to implement
    everywhere; moreover, it should be much less likely now that any
    extension would depend on another extension.  The expanded "core" now
    has all of the order-concerning operators, all of the defined
    relational operators except the "Counted" ones, and it has all of the
    operators for booleans, numerics, strings, intervals, and for TAI
    temporals.  The reduced "extensions" now has just the "Counted"
    relational operators, all of the types and operators for temporal data
    expressed as UTC dates and times, and all of the spatial types and
    operators.  In the future, when support for non-trivial pattern
    matching or regular expressions are added, those will also be as
    extensions, one extension per distinct pattern match engine/grammar,
    because those would be both complicated and sometimes non-portable.
    This release does not add or remove or alter the semantics of any types
    or routines, but simply moves around or renames them.  Just one
    exception, where a minor type used to have 2 names and now has one.

    * Split Ext/Temporal.pod into itself plus the new Ext/DateTime.pod; the
    former has the 7 TAI-specific functions
    "sys.std.Temporal.Instant.[[|abs_]diff|later|earlier]",
    "sys.std.Temporal.Duration.[abs|sum|diff]" and the 1 TAI-specific
    system-service "sys.std.Temporal.Instant.fetch_curr_instant" but no
    data types (all 2 TAI types are in Core/Types.pod); the latter has all
    of the 14 types, 11 functions, 6 system-services that are not
    TAI-specific, and are all formatted in terms of YMDHIS in the UTC or
    floating time-zone, and the latter has the 2 functions for TAI-UTC
    conversion.  So the simple TAI temporals (for time-stamps) and
    complicated UTC temporals (for user datetimes) are now fully separated.
    The TAI materials kept their "sys.std.Temporal.\w+" name-spaces while
    the UTC materials were renamed to "sys.std.DateTime.\w+".

    * Promoted 13 files and all of the materials (routines and types)
    defined therein from Ext/ to Core/:  Array.pod, Bag.pod, Blob.pod,
    Bool.pod, Integer.pod, Interval.pod, Ordered.pod, Rational.pod,
    Relation.pod, Set.pod, Text.pod, Temporal.pod, Tuple.pod.  In every one
    of these files, added "Core." to the name-spaces of every material, so
    for example every "sys.std.Integer.\w+" became
    "sys.std.Core.Integer.\w+".  Only 3 files remain in Ext/:  Counted.pod,
    DateTime.pod, Spatial.pod; their materials' name-spaces are unchanged.

    * (Routines.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod)  Moved to Routines_Catalog.pod
    from Routines.pod all 6 "sys.std.Core.Control.\w+" routines (2
    functions, 1 updater, 3 procedures), which are now grouped into 2 new
    main pod sections.  The section "ROUTINES FOR INVOKING ROUTINES" got
    the 4 "[func|upd|proc]_invo", "curried_func" and the section "ROUTINES
    FOR WORKING WITH EXCEPTIONS" got the 2 "fail", "try_catch".  Each of
    the 6 had "Cat." added to its name-space and "Control." removed, ending
    up with "sys.std.Core.Cat.func_invo" for example.

    * Added new initially-empty file Core/Cast.pod whose purpose is to
    consolidate all the type-casting routines that are conceptually monadic
    functions between 2 core types.

    * (Cast.pod, Routines.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod, Blob.pod,
    Bag.pod)  Moved to Cast.pod from Routines.pod the 2 functions
    "Tuple_from_Relation", "Relation_from_Tuple"; from Integer.pod the 6
    functions "Int_from_Text", "Text_from_Int", "Int_from_Blob_[S|U]_VBE",
    "Blob_[S|U]_VBE_from_Int"; from Rational.pod the 4 functions
    "Int_from_Rat", "Rat_from_Int", "Rat_from_Text", "Text_from_Rat"; from
    Blob.pod the 2 functions "Set_from_Bag", "Bag_from_Set"; from Bag.pod
    the 2 functions "Blob_from_Text", "Text_from_Blob".  Moved to Cast.pod
    the 2 types PInt2_36, PInt1_4; the first was in each of Integer.pod and
    Rational.pod (2 copies with distinct long names), and the second was in
    Blob.pod; the sole purpose of those types was to support the routines
    moved from the same files.  Following these moves, Integer.pod and
    Blob.pod no longer declare any types, but Rational.pod has 2 others.
    All materials in Cast.pod were renamed into "sys.std.Core.Cast.\w+".

    * Added 3 new initially-empty files Core/Universal.pod,
    Core/Scalar.pod, Core/STDIO.pod.

    * (Routines.pod, Universal.pod, Scalar.pod, Bool.pod, Tuple.pod,
    Relation.pod, STDIO.pod)  Moved every one of the routines in
    Routines.pod to one of 6 other files, such that each routine in the
    name-space "sys.std.Core.<ns>.\w+" was moved to the same-named file
    "<ns>.pod": Universal.pod got 7 functions, 1 updater; Scalar.pod got 13
    functions; Bool.pod got 5 functions; Tuple.pod got 13 functions, 4
    updaters; Relation.pod got 41 functions, 17 updaters; STDIO.pod got 7
    system-services.

    * (Ordered.pod, Interval.pod, Universal.pod)  Moved the 2 functions
    "sys.std.Core.Ordered.is[|_not]_member" from Ordered.pod to
    Interval.pod, in the process renaming them to
    "sys.std.Core.Interval.value_is[|_not]_member".  Then moved the
    remaining 10 Ordered.pod functions into Universal.pod, renaming each
    one from the "Ordered." name-space to the "Universal." name-space.

    * Removed the 2 now-empty files Core/Routines.pod, Core/Ordered.pod.

    * (Text.pod)  Made a note that each kind of regex / non-trivial pattern
    match supported will be in its own extension, only 'like' in the core.

    * Updated nearly every file that declared system-defined types or
    routines to rename most of the headings for main pod sections that
    featured said declarations.  The new names are more modern, eliminating
    any redundant "SYSTEM-DEFINED" text and now generally being of a format
    like "FUNCTIONS FOR X" rather than "X FUNCTIONS".  Similarly updated
    headings of many pod sub-sections of such mains where they exist.

    * (README, D.pm, Basics.pod, Core.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod,
    PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated any references in other
    files to the moved/renamed/etc materials/etc.

2009-11-21  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.100.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.100.0.tar.gz.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Temporarily removed the concept of private
    routines and types from Muldis D; now all entities living directly in a
    depot or subdepot are public, end of story; only lexical entities are
    still private.  This change was made to support some other language
    simplifications to follow.  The concept of private vs public will
    return in a future release, but will likely be supported in a different
    manner than before, and will probably return around the same time that
    the concept of per-database-user entity access privilages come to be
    defined.  In Basics.pod, TODO-commented-out a few sentences in the 2
    pod sub-sections "User-Defined Resources" and "Conceptions and
    Requirements".  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated each of the 7 catalog
    types "[Function|Updater|Procedure]Set",
    "[Scalar|Nonscalar|Union|Subset]TypeSet" to remove its "is_public"
    attribute (which is now effectively always true), and did a few
    TODO-comment-out in the file.  In Routines_Catalog.pod, updated each of
    the 7 routines "create_[function|updater|procedure]",
    "create_[scalar|nonscalar|union|subset]_type" to remove its "is_public"
    parameter.  In each of the 3 STD.pod files, updated "Material
    Specification Common Elements" so that a "material" node no longer has
    an optional "priv_or_pub" element; where omitting it before meant
    "private", all "material" which now don't have it anyway are "public";
    also updated all code examples in the files appropriately.

    * (Basics.pod)  In the "ENTITY NAMES" main pod section, consolidated
    each ".<type>" plus ".<routine>" line pair into a ".<material>" line.

    * (HDMD_Perl6_STD.pod)  In accordance with the latest Perl 6 spec (an
    update on 2009.11.17), mentioned that the Perl 6 "FatRat" type exists,
    alongside its "Rat".  At this point, "FatRat" is actually the closest
    approximation to the Muldis D "Rat", since the new Perl 6 "Rat" doesn't
    have a denominator larger than a 64-bit integer can represent.

2009-11-06  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.99.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.99.0.tar.gz.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new terms 'atomic', 'transaction' to the NOTES ON
    TERMINOLOGY section, in order to help both distinguish those terms from
    each other, and avoid misconception of the Muldis D spec in general.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Fixed omission from "TYPE SUMMARY" section.

    * (Makefile.PL, D.pm, Muldis_D_00_Compile.t)  Updated the distro so
    that normal users only need the most minimal dependencies reasonably
    possible, meaning it now only requires Perl 5.6.0+ rather than 5.8.1+,
    and it requires no modules at all that weren't bundled with 5.6.0+.
    This seemed appropriate since the distro is documentation-only and
    doesn't have any normal code to run, just POD to render (on the other
    hand, that POD *is* UTF-8).  Updated the test file, which exists just
    to make generic CPAN build and testing facilities happy, to use "Test"
    rather than "Test::More" since that's all Perl 5.6.0 bundled.  Also
    updated the Makefile.PL (and META.yml) to add "resources" urls.

    * Updated all author references to change Darren Duncan's stated email
    address from "perl@DarrenDuncan.net" to "darren@DarrenDuncan.net".

2009-10-20  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.98.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.98.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added new scalar catalog type
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.OVLScalar", which is an explicitly defined union
    type over all of and just the system-defined DH-scalar types for whose
    values all of the Muldis D standard dialects provide "opaque value
    literal" syntax for, which is currently 18 scalar root types.  Also
    updated the "ScaValExprNodeSet" catalog type so that its "value"
    attribute is now simply an "OVLScalar" rather than
    "DHScalar"-plus-vague-constraint-description.  This change should help
    improve portability between Muldis D implementations and dialects, as
    previously what "value" was allowed to contain was specified
    implementation or dialect dependent.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Rational.pod,
    Temporal.pod)  Updated the "TYPE SUMMARY" main pod section to insert
    new "OVLScalar" between "DHScalar" and latter's hierarchy descendants.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  Renamed the
    2 catalog types "Sca[Val|PRSel]ExprNodeSet" to
    "[OVLScaVal|ScaSel]ExprNodeSet", respectively.  Also updated the
    "ExprNodeSet" catalog type to rename is 2 attributes
    "sca_[val|pr_sel]_exprs" to "[ovl_sca_val|sca_sel]_exprs".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  The Muldis D dialects are now a bit stricter in
    semantics such that they now specify that when code is written using a
    specific kind of "value" node kind, the parser must use the same
    catalog data types for every case of the same node kind, rather than
    taking liberties in the name of optimization.  In particular, a
    "Scalar" node must now *always* parse into a ScaSelExprNodeSet tuple,
    even if its child exprs are all constants and it denotes a
    system-defined type value; conversely, a "Rat" or "UTCInstant" etc node
    must always parse into an OVLScaValExprNodeSet tuple.  Likewise for
    nonscalar selectors.  The parser must retain as much as possible of the
    specific syntax the user wrote.  Any optimization must now be separate
    from the parser, such as a separate distinct parser step that the user
    must explicitly ask for, or a runtime/JIT feature for how the
    system-catalog is compiled to machine code.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added 2 new catalog types
    "[OVLScaVal|MaterialRefSel]StmtNodeSet", each node in which represents
    assignment to a procedure variable of a newly selected OVL-scalar or
    material ref value, respectively (which are short-hands that remove the
    need to define/extend an updater to do this in most cases), and updated
    the catalog type "StmtNodeSet" to add the 2
    "[ovl_sca_val|material_ref_sel]_stmts" attrs.

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Formatting typo fix.

2009-10-18  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.97.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.97.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Basics.pod)  Split apart the unified facilities
    for imperative routine invocation into disjoint facilities for invoking
    updaters and procedures (system-services still being lumped with the
    latter).  In Types_Catalog.pod, split the catalog type
    "ImpInvoStmtNodeSet" into the 2 "[Upd|Proc]InvoStmtNodeSet", and
    updated the "StmtNodeSet" type to split the attribute "imp_invo_stmts"
    into the 2 "[upd|proc]_invo_stmts".  Also renamed the catalog type
    "ImpRef" to "ProcRef" and rearranged the type hierarchy so that both
    "UpdRef" and "ProcRef" are directly under "MaterialRef" rather than
    "UpdRef" being under "ImpRef".  In Routines.pod, renamed the procedure
    "imp_invo" to "proc_invo" and renamed its "imperative" parameter to
    "procedure".  Following these changes, both the "proc_invo" and
    "try_catch" procedures can now only take refs to procedures (or
    system-services) as arguments, and no longer also refs to updaters.  In
    the 3 STD files, updated the "Library Entity Reference Selector" pod
    sub-section to split the "imp-ref" node kind into the 2
    "[upd|proc]-ref".  In Basics.pod, a minor related desc update.

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the code examples in the "CATALOG
    ABSTRACTION LEVELS" main pod section to reflect that the 1-2 payload
    elements of a 'depot' node are each now wrapped in a Perl Pair or
    single-elem hash-ref whose key is "depot-catalog" or "depot-data", so
    to make depot declaration Perl-STD code better self-documenting.  Then
    further updated said examples to reflect that the 4th,5th,6th used
    elements of a 'function' node (result-type, params, expr) are now
    wrapped up in a function-payload Perl array ref, with that now being
    the collective 4th element of 'function'.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Renamed the placeholder
    "DEPOT DECLARATION" main pod section to "DEPOT SPECIFICATION" and
    completely fleshed it out with updated grammar, description, and code
    examples.  So these main node kinds are now formally defined: "depot",
    "subdepot", "self_local_dbvar_type"; the last of these is newly added
    in PTMD_STD.  In PTMD_STD, these grammar elements were renamed:
    "depot_or_subdepot" -> "depot_catalog_payload",
    "named_[subdepot|material]" -> "subdepot|material".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added new main pod section
    "MATERIAL SPECIFICATION", just following "DEPOT SPECIFICATION", which
    has 1 sub-section "Material Specification Common Elements".  Herein,
    the "material" node is fully defined with grammar and description, and
    has 7 main variants, one each for the 3 main routine kinds and 4 main
    type-declaration methods.  A material has 2-4 elements that are common
    to all material kinds, which are material-kind, priv-or-pub,
    material-declared-name, and material-payload.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In the "MATERIAL
    SPECIFICATION" main pod section, added these 7 empty placeholder pod
    sub-sections, which will be populated in near-future spec releases:
    "[Function|Updater|Procedure|[Scalar|Nonscalar|Union|Subset] Type]
    Specification".

2009-10-14  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.96.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.96.1.tar.gz.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the "LANGUAGE NAME"
    main pod section to make example code invoke highest abstraction level.

    * (Routines.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, Ordered.pod, Bool.pod,
    Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod, Rational.pod, Tuple.pod, Relation.pod,
    Set.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod, Interval.pod, Counted.pod, Temporal.pod)
    In a reversal of one aspect of release 0.62.2, reformatted all
    system-defined routine signatures to match the planned new PTMD_STD
    format for declaring routines, such that the type annotation for each
    parameter is now on the right side of the parameter name rather then on
    the left side.  Where parameter declarations used to be formatted "T1
    $p1" or "T1 &$p1" or "T1 $p1?", they are now formatted "$p1 : T1" or
    "&$p1 : T1" or "$p1? : T1".  (Not yet shown, this formatting change
    will also apply to type attribute declarations and variable
    declarations, etc.)  This change only slightly increases the verbosity
    (opt by 2 chars per param) but carries a number of benefits: 1. The
    PTMD_STD dialect now has greater similarity to the HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD
    dialects, which already have each param's type annotation on the right
    side of the param's name. 2. Having the type annotation on the
    right-hand side also better lends itself to code that defines a type
    inline with the code where it's used (likely to be very common), which
    should make code an order of magnitude easier to read in the general
    case. 3. Even without the possibility of embedding, the code should be
    easier to read now than before. 4. With this formatting change, Muldis
    D in general is now more similar to both SQL and Tutorial D etc than
    before, important to help with learnability or migration.  Now while
    this change does make Muldis D a bit less like Perl 6 or C languages,
    it does then become more like (besides SQL etc) Haskell or Pascal or
    Scala or JScript (also the last 3 share the colon separator).

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated 2 code examples according to prior chg item.

2009-10-13  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.96.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.96.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Relaxed the restriction on when system-defined
    routine definitions in the system-catalog may have specified routine
    bodies; now any function|updater|procedure either may have or may omit
    a body.  Updated the 2 catalog types "Sys[Upd|Proc]Set" to add a
    "body" attribute like that of "SysFuncSet", all 3 less restrictive.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Refactored the catalog types for specifying
    routines so they are more like the ones for specifying types; merged
    the type-pairs that specified routine headings and bodies into single
    types that specify both.  Merged the 6 catalog types
    "[Func|Upd|Proc][Head|Body]" into the 3 "Function|Procedure|Updater";
    the post merge types have all of the same attributes as the originals
    but for now only having 1 "comment" each rather than 2.  The post-merge
    versions were also enhanced so that all of the attributes for
    specifying the routine bodies are now optional (to support
    system-defined routines in general); these attributes all happen to be
    relations or tuples of relations, and so a routine body is assumed to
    be missing when those relations are all empty and existing when at
    least one has a tuple.  Also a minor corresponding update to the
    "MultiUpdStmt" catalog type.  Also renamed the 6 catalog types
    "[|Sys][Func|Upd|Proc]Set" to "[|Sys][Function|Updater|Procedure]Set"
    and for each one updated it to merge its 2 "head|body" attributes into
    the 1 "material" attribute.  Also updated each of the 8 catalog types
    "[|Sys][Scalar|Nonscalar|Union|Subset]TypeSet" to rename its "type"
    attribute to "material".

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Corresponding to the prior change item,
    updated each of the 3 catalog procedures
    "create_[function|updater|procedure]" to merge its 2 "head|body"
    parameters into the 1 "material" parameter.  Also updated each of the 4
    "create_[scalar|nonscalar|union|subset]_type" to rename its "type"
    parameter to "material".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the "DEPOT DECLARATION" main pod section to
    refactor the "depot" node; the "<Database> | <depot_or_subdepot>" value
    choice for "depot-catalog" has been factored out to a "catalog" node.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the "Scalar
    Selectors" pod sub-section to add 2 code examples on how to select
    "Int" or "Text" values just in terms of the singleton "String.*" types.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the "LANGUAGE NAME"
    main pod section to make the "ln_extensions" 5th name part mandatory
    rather than opt, because at least one mand pragma will be added next.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Generalized the
    "with_rtn_inv_alt_syn" pragma into the "catalog_abstraction_level"
    pragma, where the latter is more extensible, and defines concentric
    subsets of Muldis D grammar size, where the larger/higher ones are
    increasingly abstracted from the system catalog representation of
    Muldis D code.  The "plain_rtn_inv" and "rtn_inv_alt_syn" values for
    the new pragma are direct matches for the "false" and "true" values,
    respectively, of the old pragma; the "plain_rtn_inv" level represents
    almost all system-defined operators as polish notation routine calls
    like user-defined ones would be, while the highest "rtn_inv_alt_syn"
    level adds terser special syntax for over a hundred built-in operators,
    to resemble other general purpose languages the most.  The new pragma
    also has 2 additional values:  A new lower level "code_as_data" is as
    direct a match as possible for the system catalog, presenting the
    system catalog as a "Database:Depot" value literal, which also harkens
    back to earlier days of the Muldis D spec when the concrete grammar was
    only capable of specifying value literals.  A new yet-lower level
    "the_floor" exists just for academic purposes, showing how far one can
    go to strip down the grammar but still support all Muldis D semantic
    features.  Replaced the old main pod section "MULDIS D STANDARD DIALECT
    PRAGMAS" with the new main pod section "CATALOG ABSTRACTION LEVELS"
    (the latter located just following "LANGUAGE NAME"), which has a pod
    sub-section for each of the 4 levels.  The new main pod section
    features a visual comparison of the 4 abstractions, by demonstrating
    how to write the same simple Muldis D code in each of them.  The 3
    highest levels demonstrate how to write a complete depot (with language
    name) which simply declares a function that results in the cube of its
    integer argument.  The 2 lowest levels demonstrate how to write a
    simple 2x2 relation value literal.  The "code_as_data" level had both
    examples, the other 3 levels had just 1 example each.  In PTMD_STD.pod,
    each of the 4 abstraction levels has its own definition for the 3
    grammar nodes "value", "catalog", "expr"; this is the semi-formal way
    in which the effects of each level on the grammar are specified.  The
    old pragma just redefined "expr" for each level, not the other two.
    In "NESTING PRECEDENCE RULES", noted "code_as_data" has just 1 prec lv.

2009-10-08  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.95.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.95.0.tar.gz.

    * Oops, the previous releases 0.9[3|4].0 shipped with code all decl as
    version 0.092000 rather than 0.09[3|4]000; metadata was correct though.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, Basics.pod)  In the PTMD_STD dialect, split up the
    "Comment" node into itself and the new "non_value_comment" node, where
    each is now specialized for particular disjoint purposes.  "Comment"
    now has a payload delimited by backticks ("`") rather than hash-marks
    ("#"), with simple rules the same as "Text", and it is just used in
    code like normal data is, and is the only version that a "value" or
    "expr" node may "be".  The new "non_value_comment" retains the more
    complicated hash-mark-delimited syntax of the old version, and is now
    just used in the "put it anywhere as metadata" use, and it never has a
    prefix such as "Comment:".  The new "Comment" is also now an 8th type
    whose literals may always be a SCVL format in a GCVL context, because
    it is distinguished as the only thing to use backticks.  This split was
    done partly to avoid the problems arising from when the same syntax was
    useable both in a normal expression as well as sprinklable anywhere.
    Both versions are members of the tightest nesting precedence level.
    Also added new "escaped_char" "\g" to repr a backtick/grave-accent.
    In Basics.pod, updated "NOTES ON TEXT CHARACTER LITERALS" re backticks.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Renamed the "payload" node to
    "value_payload", so the name wouldn't conflict with future additions.

    * As a new general design change, all multi-word keywords in Muldis D
    that would otherwise be written out either with single underscores
    between the words or whitespace between the words will instead have
    single hyphens between the words officially.  This affects all the
    names of routine kinds, and the leading keywords for many kinds of
    entity definitions in the concrete grammars, and any infix/etc operator
    name tokens in the grammars.  A benefit of this change is that
    tokenizing Muldis D code should be easier, and there is more
    consistency between the plain-text and Perl-hosted-data dialects as to
    how the various keywords are spelled, especially since possibly
    variable whitespace in the middle of a keyword (or alternately the
    enforcement of user-error-prone single spaces) is now off the table.
    Also, hyphens were used instead of underscores because arguably they
    read better, more like the whitespace they mean to loosely represent,
    and hyphens are easier to type, and also hyphens stand out more
    visually since multi-word entity names (materials, variables, etc) are
    typically underscore-sep by convention (hyphens legal there though).

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod,
    Routines_Catalog.pod, Ordered.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod,
    Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod, Array.pod, Interval.pod,
    Temporal.pod)  In the "ROUTINES" main pod section of Basics.pod,
    renamed all 11 routine kinds whose names had multiple words, replacing
    any underscores with hyphens; the new names of those 11 routine kinds
    are: "system-service", "[type|state|transition]-constraint",
    "named-value", "possrep-map", "virtual-attr-map",
    "order-determination", "value-[filter|map|reduction]".  In all 14
    files, updated any references on those routine kinds to the new names.
    In the case of "system-catalog", some of these references were in the
    signatures of the system-defined routines in the routine references.

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Renamed 7 node kind keywords to replace any
    underscores with hyphens; their new names are: "func-invo",
    "if-else-expr", "given-when-def-expr",
    "[func|proc|type|ord-det-func]-ref".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Renamed 4 infix operator multi-word keywords from
    forms that had exactly 1 space character between the words to have
    single hyphens instead; their new names are: "cross-join", "not-isa",
    "not-matching", "not-like".  These were the only instances of
    fixed-length whitespace inside multi-word keywords.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  In the "DEPOT DECLARATION" main pod section, changed
    the syntaxes "depot \s+ [catalog|data]" to "'depot-[catalog|data]'",
    respectively.  These were the only instances of variable-length
    whitespace inside multi-word keywords.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In the "Rational Operators
    That Do Rounding" pod sub-section, renamed the "loge" postfix operator
    keyword to "log-e", which is easier to read.

    * (Routines.pod, Rational.pod, Text.pod)  Updated the also-known-as
    notes for 5 functions in correspondence to above-mentioned changes.

    * (Types.pod, Array.pod)  Typo fixes.

2009-10-05  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.94.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.94.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features the addition of generic parameterizable
    interval types to Muldis D as a core feature, where they are just as
    much first-class citizens as the likes of "set", "maybe", "array", and
    "bag".  An "interval" is conceptually like a "set" but that rather than
    its member values being defined via enumeration as with a normal
    relation value, they are defined in terms of being every value of a
    particular orderable type that is orderable between a particular pair
    of endpoint values.  An "interval" is represented in Muldis D as a
    tuple with 4 attributes which define a pair of endpoint values plus an
    indicator of whether each endpoint is included in the interval.  The
    language was also refactored in small suitable ways to use single
    interval values where it used to use multiple values to represent
    ranges or limits for an operation.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Several instances of making the grammar stricter with
    regards to whitespace.  Updated every kind of "value" regarding the
    value literal element separator (":") or value literal payload element
    separator (";") that each value literal may have, so that instead of
    there being optional whitespace just to the left of it, there must now
    be no whitespace just to the left of it; for example, where "Int : 1 ;
    11001001" used to be valid, it must now be such as "Int: 1; 11001001"
    or "Int:1;11001001" instead.  Also updated the "language_name" to
    remove the optional whitespace just to the right of each ":" that is
    between the language name elements.  Also updated the "named_expr" so
    that whitespace on both sides of the "::=" is now mandatory rather than
    optional.  Also updated the "func_invo" to remove the optional
    whitespace between the function name and the argument list; for
    example, where "myfunc ( 3 )" used to be valid, it must now be such as
    "myfunc( 3 )"; this change is particularly important, as it should make
    the parser simpler in how it determines whether the "myfunc" it
    encountered is a keyword or special-syntax (which tend to have
    mandatory separating whitespace) versus a generic function invocation,
    especially with the previous release's changes concerning the explicit
    expression delimiters being made optional.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the main pod section "NESTING PRECEDENCE
    RULES" to add a new tighter precedence level for the triadic comparison
    operators, so that the likes of "not $min < $foo ≤ $max" would now
    parse as a single entity without say "$min < $foo" always being eaten
    as a complete operation instead.

    * (Types.pod, Basics.pod)  In Types.pod, added 2 new generic tuple
    types "sys.std.Core.Type.[|DH]Interval" to the language core, each of
    which has 2 "Universal"-typed attributes named "min|max" and 2
    "Bool"-typed attributes named "excludes_[min|max]"; the "min|max"
    attributes are parameterizable as per the "value" attribute of the
    Set|Array|Bag types.  In Basics.pod, updated the "Referencing Data
    Types" pod sub-section of "ENTITY NAMES" to add support for the terse
    inline parameterized interval type decl prefixes "[|dh_]interval_of.".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added new catalog type "IvlSelExprNodeSet" which
    supports a more compact representation of an Interval value selection
    expression node than a "TupSelExprNodeSet" does; this is at the
    Array|Bag-specific-selector-like limitation that the
    "excludes_[min|max]" attributes of the Interval selector are
    compile-time constants (which is typically okay); defining those
    attributes at runtime requires the likes of a "TupSelExprNodeSet".
    Also updated the catalog type "ExprNodeSet" to add a 13th attribute
    "ivl_sel_exprs" of the new catalog type.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added new pod sub-section
    named "Interval Selectors" to the end of the main pod section
    "COLLECTION VALUE SELECTORS", which declares new literal/selector
    syntax specific to Interval values.  An Interval selector is designed
    to mimic the literal syntax and features of Perl 6's "Range" type, and
    generally you define an Interval in terms of a pair of value literals
    or expressions separated by one of these 4 character strings: '..',
    '..^', '^..', '^..^'.  For parsing simplicity an Interval GCVL in
    PTMD_STD, the separated pair is delimited, for example as
    "Interval:{10^..20}", but in some specific contexts the delimiter
    wouldn't be necessary.  In HDMD_Perl6_STD, a straight-up Perl Range may
    be used to represent an Interval literal, such as "10^..20".  In
    HDMD_Perl5_STD, an Interval node payload is a 3 element Perl arrayref
    with the string '^..'/etc being the middle element.

    * (Ordered.pod)  Renamed the 2 functions "is_[in|out]side_range" to
    "is_[|not_]member" (with additional aka of "I∈", "I∉"), respectively,
    and refactored their parameter lists so each of them now takes a single
    "interval" argument rather than the 4 "min|max","m[in|ax]_is_outside",
    and the "topic" param is renamed to "value"; the "func" param is
    unchanged.  The updated functions also now have more liberal semantics
    that they no longer fail if "max" is before "min"; now they just treat
    that scenario as "interval" being an empty interval, meaning all
    candidate "value" would not be considered included in it.  The existing
    also-known-as notes for these functions were retained unchanged, save
    for the additional ones.

    * Added new file "lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Interval.pod" which houses the new
    "Muldis D Interval Extension".  This extension defines an initial
    complement of 2 interval-specific new functions
    "sys.std.Interval.has_[|not_]member" (aka "I∋", "I∌").  This function
    pair and the prior-mentioned 2 in Ordered.pod are aliases for each
    other.  Still TODO is fleshing out Interval.pod with more functions.

    * (D.pm, Core.pod, README)  Added basic references to the new
    Interval.pod file.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the "Order Comparison
    Operators" pod sub-section corresponding to prior-mentioned changes.
    Accounted for the changes to what functions the ternary operators like
    "≤≤" map to, and so now each of those doesn't just map to a 5+ argument
    function, but instead to a 4 argument Interval selector plus a 2+
    argument function ("Ordered.is_[|not_]member").  Also added 4 new
    dyadic compare ops 'I∈','I∉','I∋','I∌'; 1 per distinct new/chg interval
    func.  Also added an example code piece for "I∈" to all 3 files.

    * (Relation.pod)  Updated each of the 2 functions
    "limit[|_by_attr_names]" to merge its 2 "m[in|ax]_rank" parameters into
    a single "rank_interval" parameter.  Each updated function is also more
    flexible now such that tuples whose ranks match one or both of the
    min|max may optionally be excluded from the result as per "^", and it
    is now more liberal concerning max-before-min.

    * (Array.pod)  Updated each of the 3 functions "slice",
    "limit_of_Array_from_wrap[|_by_attr_names]" to merge its 2
    "[first|last]_index" parameters into a single "index_interval"
    parameter.  Each updated function is also more flexible now such that
    elems whose indexes match one or both of the first|last may optionally
    be excluded from the result as per "^", and it is now more liberal
    concerning last-bef-first.  Also this op is now aka "[]", not "[..]".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the "Simple
    Postcircumfix Operators" pod sub-section corresponding to the
    "Array.slice" changes.  The "op" for "slice" is now "[]", not "[..]".
    For both HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD, the second main op arg of the "[]" op now
    is simply an Interval node payload rather than a 2-element arrayref,
    which for Perl 6 can just be a Perl Range.  For PTMD_STD, accounted for
    changes to the "slice" function that "[]" maps to.

    * (Integer.pod, Rational.pod)  Updated each of the 2 functions
    "[Integer|Rational].fetch_random" to merge its 4 "[|exclude_]m[in|ax]"
    parameters into a single "interval" parameter.  Also expanded the
    restriction against max-before-min to instead be against any empty
    "interval".

    * (Basics.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, Tuple.pod)  Other minor updates and fixes.

2009-09-28  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.93.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.93.0.tar.gz.

    * Updated the README file to indicate that this distribution now has 2
    public Git repositories, one on GitHub.com and one on utsl.gen.nz.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Changed the nature of expression-delimiting
    parenthesis so that they are now completely generic and can delimit any
    kind of "expr" at all, including themselves, and so they are optional
    to use; this is all to be in keeping with common practice in
    programming languages where generally the only reason to use expr
    delimiting parenthesis is to force a particular nesting precedence for
    sub-expressions.  And so it is also no longer mandatory for if-else or
    given-when-default or generic alternate function invocation syntax
    expressions to have parenthesis delimiters, though in practice they may
    often be used with such code anyway.  Also updated all the code
    examples that were entirely paren-delimited to remove said delimiters.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Added new main pod section "NESTING PRECEDENCE RULES"
    just above "SEE ALSO", which groups all the kinds of "expr" into about
    7 precedence levels, so it is explicitly known when
    expression-delimiting parenthesis may be safely omitted as far as a
    parser is concerned, though in practice some parenthesis may still be
    used when not needed simply to aid human readability.  The basic order
    from tightest to loosest precedence is: terms / value literals /
    expression name useage / etc, accessors and postfix ops, prefix ops,
    dyadic infix ops, infix reduction ops, if-else and given-when exprs,
    expr-naming exprs.  Also, most levels of ops are left-associative,
    espec all reg infix.  Also upd more code examples to rem more parens.

    * Muldis::D version 0.92.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.92.0.tar.gz.

    * As of this release, this Muldis D language specification distribution
    no longer contains supplementary files that aren't part of the language
    spec itself, and so any subsequent releases of this distribution should
    always constitute spec updates, and not supplementary material changes.

    * All of the files removed by this release are being released to CPAN
    concurrently to this release as the initial content of the initial
    release of the new distribution Muldis-D-Manual.

    * The transferred files were all of the 10 files constituting the
    entire archives/ and util/ folders:

        archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_lt.xul
        archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_sa.xul
        archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul
        archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt
        archives/README
        archives/takahashi.css
        archives/takahashi.js
        util/BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist
        util/Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin
        util/README

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Added new main pod section "FURTHER DOCUMENTATION"
    which refers to the new Muldis::D::Manual distro, just above the
    "INFORMATION SOURCES" main pod section.

    * Updated the README file concerning the post-split status.

    * This release has no other changes save for administering the above.

2009-09-21  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.91.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.91.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod)  In a reversal of one aspect of
    release 0.89.0, updated the catalog type "Depot" to re-add the
    attribute "data", with which one can explicitly indicate whether the
    depot/subdepot has a self-local dbvar, and if so what its declared type
    is.  Also updated the description of "Depot" to no longer say that a
    child entity declared name of the empty string is reserved for any
    purpose.  In Basics.pod, added new pod sub-section named "Empty-String
    Names" under "ENTITY NAMES", and made some large updates to the "User
    Namespace Correspondence" sub-section.  The changes/additions no longer
    say that an empty string name is reserved for a dbvar type etc, nor
    that a dbvar type can't be "just a database" (it now can if there are
    no child subdepots or materials, and the language feature is added
    about any namespace containing an empty string named material can now
    be referenced directly as a proxy for said material, and this also
    cascades if said parent namespace itself has an empty name.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Corrected a mistake in the "Depot" catalog type
    desc (intr by v0.90.0); it has a binary distrib primary key not unary.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod)  Renamed the
    concept of a restriction-defined type to a subset-defined type, mainly
    because that name is shorter and can be used everywhere unabbreviated,
    which gives consistency with the other 3 main ways of declaring types.
    Renamed the 3 catalog types "RestrType", "[|Sys]RestrTypeSet" to
    "SubsetType", "[|Sys]SubsetTypeSet", and updated each of the 2 catalog
    types "Depot", "System" to rename its "restr_types" attribute to
    "subset_types".  Renamed the 2 data-definition procedures
    "[create|drop]_restr_type" to "[create|drop]_subset_type".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated each of the 7 catalog types
    "[Func|Upd|Proc]Set", "[Scalar|Nonscalar|Union|Subset]TypeSet" to
    rename its "subdepot" attr to "parent", to increase spec consistency.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-09-19  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.90.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.90.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a refactoring of the mid-level DBMS entity
    namespaces, specifically [depot, subdepot, package, material/"inner"].
    To start with, the distinct "package" concept has been eliminated, and
    its only distinctive feature (the ability to designate each material as
    either public or private) is now available to materials directly in
    depots or subdepots; and so, a Muldis D subdepot now represents *both*
    the SQL concept of a "schema" *and* the Oracle concept of a "package".
    From the other end, the distinct concepts of "inner" and "outer"
    materials no longer exists, such that an "outer material" was just a
    proxy for one of several "inner material" that it encapsulated, the
    others being support.  Now instead, the "outer" has been replaced with
    another layer of subdepot as required, and now every "inner" now lives
    directly in the subdepot tree, and might be directly referenceable.

    * (Basics.pod)  Multiple updates throughout the "ENTITY NAMES" main pod
    section, and in the "User-Defined Resources" pod sub-section of
    "RESOURCE MODULARITY AND PERSISTENCE", to eliminate the distinct
    concept of "package", such that any references to it were either
    removed or changed to "subdepot"; similarly, the entity namespaces
    "pkg.*" and "tpc.pkg.*" were eliminated, and any references either
    removed or changed to "sdp.*" or "tpc.sdp.*", respectively.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the "DepotOrPackage" catalog type to
    "Depot" (and renamed the main pod section "TYPES FOR DEFINING DEPOTS
    AND SUBDEPOTS AND PACKAGES" to remove the " AND PACKAGES"), and removed
    its "packages" attribute, and updated its description to now say it
    represents a depot/subdepot only and not also a package.  Also removed
    the "PackageSet" catalog type.  Also updated the "MaterialSet" catalog
    type to remove its "package" attribute and to update the type of its
    "is_public" attribute from "maybe_of.Bool" to plain "Bool", and updated
    its description as appropriate.  Also updated the "TopicNSControlCat"
    catalog type to remove its "topic_package" attribute.  Also updated the
    descs of the 3 catalog types "System", "SubdepotSet", "Material" and
    the text of the "TYPES FOR SPECIAL ENTITY REFERENCES" main pod section.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Removed the whole pod sub-section "Procedures
    For Defining Package Routines and Data Types"; removed the 2 procedures
    "[create|drop]_package_material".  Also added a "is_public" parameter
    to the "create_depot_material" procedure.  Also removed the 2
    procedures "[create|drop]_package".  Also removed the "package"
    param of the "select_topic_namespaces" proc.  Also other rel desc chgs.

    * (Basics.pod)  Multiple updates throughout the "ROUTINES" and "ENTITY
    NAMES" main pod sections, to eliminate the distinction between "inner"
    and "outer" materials (types and routines).  Removed the 3 routine
    kinds "inner_[function|updater|procedure]" and any not removed
    references to them were replaced by references to their non-"inner_"
    counterparts.  And so now there are just 4 primary routine kinds left,
    [function, updater, system_service, procedure], and *all* of them may
    be invoked from another host language.  The entity namespace "inn.*"
    was eliminated, and any references either removed or changed to
    "sdp.*".  Most of the new description text additions under "ENTITY
    NAMES" were in the "Conceptions and Requirements" and "User Namespace
    Correspondence" pod sub-sections; in the latter, added the new feature
    that a subdepot/relvar duality may now exist, so that we now
    conceptually are able to bundle a relvar's type definition into the
    relvar, as SQL does.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated all 7 catalog types ("Possrep[|Map]Set",
    "Inner[Scalar|Nonscalar|Union|Restr]Type", "VirtualAttrMapSet") having
    at least 1 attribute that held a reference to a routine (a function in
    every case), and changed the declared type of every one of the 15 such
    attributes to "NameChain" from "Name".  Prior to the change, all such
    referenceable routines had to be "inner" routines, but now the routines
    may be anywhere.  Each changed attribute had 1 of these 12 names:
    "[|subtype_]constraint", "[|tuple|relation]_constraints",
    "default[|_[tuple|relation]]", "p1_from_p2", "p2_from_p1",
    "virtual_attr_map", "order".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the 10 catalog types
    "Inner[Func|Upd|Proc][Body|Set]",
    "Inner[Scalar|Nonscalar|Union|Restr]Type" to remove the "Inner", the 4
    "Inner[Sca|Nonsca|Uni|Restr]TypeSet" to
    "[Scalar|Nonscalar|Union|Restr]TypeSet", and updated the "Material"
    catalog type to rename its 7 attributes "inner_[func|upd|proc]s",
    "inner_[sca|nonsca|uni|restr]_types" to
    "functions|updaters|procedures",
    "[scalar|nonscalar|union|restr]_types".  Also renamed the 3 main pod
    sections "TYPES FOR DEFINING INNER [ROUTINE [HEADINGS|BODIES]|DATA
    TYPES]" to remove the "INNER ".  Also updated any other documentation
    references to "inner|outer types/etc" to remove the "inner|outer".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Some pod section rearranging, which has no
    material effect on the spec.  Merged the 2 main pod sections "TYPES FOR
    DEFINING ROUTINE [HEADINGS|BODIES]" into the 1 "TYPES FOR DEFINING
    ROUTINES"; each of the 3 catalog type decl "[Func|Upd|Proc]Head" was
    moved downwards so it is now directly above its corresponding
    "[Func|Upd|Proc]Body" type decl.  Merged the 1 main pod section "TYPES
    FOR DEFINING ROUTINES AND DATA TYPES" into the 1 "TYPES FOR DEFINING
    DEPOTS AND SUBDEPOTS"; the "Material" catalog type decl was moved
    upwards so it is now directly below the "Depot" type decl.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Annotated the "TYPES FOR SPECIAL ENTITY
    REFERENCES" main pod section to say it still requires heavy editing.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Merged the catalog type "Material" into "Depot";
    the combined type has the 7 attributes "functions|updaters|procedures",
    "[scalar|nonscalar|union|restr]_types" from "Material" plus the 2
    attributes "comment", "subdepots" from "Depot" but not "materials" from
    "Depot".  Merged the catalog type "MaterialSet" separately into all 7
    of "[Func|Upd|Proc]Set", "[Scalar|Nonscalar|Union|Restr]TypeSet"; each
    of the 7 types kept all of its existing 3-4 attributes ("name",
    "comment" and "head", "body" or "type") and also gained the 2
    "subdepot", "is_public" from "MaterialSet" and also now has a binary
    primary key.  Refactored the catalog types for declaring/defining
    system-defined materials.  The "SysTypeSet" catalog type was split into
    the 4 "Sys[Scalar|Nonscalar|Union|Restr]TypeSet", which are identical
    save for what kind of "*Type" catalog type they embed; the catalog type
    "System" was also updated so its "types" attribute was split into the 4
    "[scalar|nonscalar|union|restr]_types".  Updated the "SysFuncSet"
    catalog type to add a "body" attribute which is "Maybe" typed; the idea
    is that functions which are just part of the definition of a
    system-defined type will have their bodies defined, while normal s-d
    functions won't.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  As a partial reversion to version 0.77.0 of
    the language spec, split the 2 data-definition procedures
    "[create|drop]_depot_material" into the 14
    "[create|drop]_[function|updater|procedure]",
    "[create|drop]_[scalar|nonscalar|union|restr]_type".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Refactored the grammar nodes in the "DEPOT
    DECLARATION" main pod section to merge package stuff into subdepot
    stuff.  Also updated the "Generic Function Invocation Expressions" pod
    sub-section to excise mention of the "inn" namespace getting the
    special cases that "sys.std" gets regarding positional arguments, where
    parameters of any names may take positional ars if there are just 1-2
    mandatory ones.  Also small desc updates in "DBMS Entity Name Literals"
    to remove mention of 'pkg' and 'inn'.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated all the code examples
    to use the "sdp.lib.*" namespace. where they used "inn.*".  Related
    small description changes.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Other minor description
    updates corresponding to recent spec changes.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Upd corres to recent spec chgs.

2009-09-13  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.89.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.89.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod)  Updated the "DepotOrPackage" catalog
    type to remove its "data" attribute, which had been the main indicator
    of whether a depot/subdepot/package had a self-local dbvar and if so
    then what its type was.  Now instead, the data type of every
    depot/etc's self-local dbvar is defined by that depot/etc's immediate
    child data type definition whose declared name is the empty string; so
    empty-string names in the public namespaces are now reserved for this
    purpose and one may no longer declare a
    subdepot/package/material/relvar with the empty string for a name,
    except for the single item with that implicit purpose.  Also updated
    the "User Namespace Correspondence" pod sub-section of "ENTITY NAMES"
    with corresponding description changes.  Also in the same sub-section,
    updated the mention of the possibility of using "just a database" as
    the declared type of a self-local dbvar, so to say that this is
    actually impossible, and that at least some database values would have
    to be disallowed due to namespace conflicts with their attribute names.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Moved the main pod section
    "DEPOT DECLARATION" upwards to be just before the main pod section
    "GENERIC VALUE EXPRESSIONS".  So from now on, grammar elements which
    are not part of the "value" sub-language are now declared in roughly
    the same order as their corresponding system catalog types in
    Types_Catalog.pod, meaning essentially top-down order.  All the grammar
    elements which are part of the "value" sub-language will remain
    declared prior to all the elements which are not.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Fixed a fossil from changes
    in v0.68.0 by renaming the "TINY" of the main pod section "MULDIS D
    STANDARD TINY PRAGMAS" to "STANDARD".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Demoted the routine
    invocation alternate syntaxes to an optional extension of the STD
    dialects, so more minimal Muldis D implementations may now omit that
    significant complexity if they want, though non-minimal implementations
    should support them.  Moved the main pod section "MULDIS D STANDARD
    DIALECT PRAGMAS" upwards to be just before the main pod section
    "FUNCTION INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS", and the latter is
    now subservient to the former.  Fleshed out the moved PRAGMAS section
    with, and updated the "LANGUAGE NAME" pod section to mention, a newly
    first pragma "with_rtn_inv_alt_syn"; this pragma must now be explicitly
    activated in the language declaration of Muldis D code for that code to
    make use of the routine invocation alternate syntaxes, whereas before
    code could use them by default.  In the "GENERIC VALUE EXPRESSIONS"
    main pod section, refactored the "expr" node definition by splitting
    that into itself and the new "expr_core_options" node, which has all of
    the old options of "expr" except for "func_invo_alt_syntax"; so now the
    effect of activating the new pragma is to redefine the "expr" node to
    add "func_invo_alt_syntax" as an option.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the "DEPOT DECLARATION" main pod section to
    flesh out the grammar some more, so it now basically covers all the
    syntax to declare whole depots, subdepots, and packages, but not yet
    materials or any of what goes inside materials.  There were no
    descriptive text additions to describe that grammar nor examples nor
    any corresponding additions in HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod.  This "DEPOT
    DECLARATION" stuff may be rewritten next update anyway.

2009-09-12  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.88.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.88.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features the elimination of the "bootloader" concept,
    namely Muldis D code that doesn't live in a depot (and that isn't a
    simple value literal).  You must now use in-depot code to do whatever
    you would have used a "bootloader" for.  For your "main program" in a
    non-hosted Muldis D environment, you now put that code in a procedure
    of a depot and mark that procedure as being a stimulus-response rule
    (trigger) where the stimulus is the mounting of its host depot.  Now to
    make a database restore script, you simply have another depot holding
    all the database's schema and data, and that has a procedure which will
    clone itself to another database; similarly, doing a whole database
    dump / backup works in exactly the same manner.  Since a possible
    physical representation of a depot is simply a Muldis D source code
    file, you can still write code as normal even if you're actually
    writing a depot, same as you'd write a library in a gen purp language.

    * (Basics.pod)  Formatting typo fix, other minor fixes.

    * (Basics.pod)  Renamed the "triggered routine" concept (analogous to
    general case of a SQL trigger) to "stimulus-response rule", and updated
    any referring documentation to no longer say that the concept is
    unsupported for the forseeable future; in fact it now is officially
    supported (and required for the featured change item), though its
    details are not yet specified.  The updated docs were all in the
    "ROUTINES" pod sub-section "Other Matters", and the "TRANSACTIONS AND
    CONCURRENCY" main pod section.

    * (Basics.pod)  In the "ROUTINES" main pod section, split up the
    routine kind hierarchy diagram into 2, with all the specific-API
    functional kinds being separated out, the reason being that their
    distinction is orthogonal to the function/inner-function distinction.

    * (Basics.pod)  In the "ROUTINES" main section, removed the
    "bootloader_exclusive" and "bootloader" routine kinds and part of the
    "Other Matters" pod sub-section.  Updated the "Type Safety" pod
    sub-section of "TYPE SYSTEM".  Multiple updates to the "TRANSACTIONS
    AND CONCURRENCY" main pod section; for one thing, there are no longer
    any transactions that aren't scope bound, except possibly for direct
    use by other host languages as an implementation permits.  Updated the
    "User-Defined Resources" pod sub-section of "RESOURCE MODULARITY AND
    PERSISTENCE".  Updated the "User-Defined Entities" and "Time-Varying
    Topic Namespaces" pod sub-sections of "ENTITY NAMES".

    * (Routines.pod)  Removed the whole pod main section "SYSTEM-DEFINED
    GENERIC BOOTLOADER EXCLUSIVES", and all 3 bootloader_exclusive routines
    "[start|commit|rollback]_trans".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  The catalog type "SysProcSet" (and hence the
    "procedures" attribute of the "System" catalog type) is no longer used
    to specify bootloader exclusive routines.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Gutted the main description text of the main
    pod section "PROCEDURES FOR BOOTSTRAPPING A MULDIS D PROGRAM OR
    DATABASE" as the procedures are no longer mainly just to allow
    bootloaders to work at all, but now they are simply convenient ways to
    do data definition in normal procedures.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  The root grammar token for
    the entire dialect is renamed to "Muldis_D" from "bootloader", and it
    is now just a "language_name" plus a "value" or "depot", rather than
    also having a third option of a sequence of "boot_stmt".  The main pod
    section "BOOTLOADER" was renamed to "START" and had a number of
    updates.  The main pod section "BOOTLOADER STATEMENT" was removed
    entirely.  There were a number of related smaller updates in various
    sections.  In PTMD_STD.pod, large updates to the "GENERAL STRUCTURE"
    main pod section.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul, BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)
    Updates corresponding to recent spec changes.

2009-09-03  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.87.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.87.0.tar.gz.

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Fixed fossils from v0.73.0 regarding
    normalization of the basic format of "func_invo_alt_syntax"/"op" nodes;
    some example code in "Generic If-Else Expressions" wasn't updated.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the concrete syntax
    for generic scalar literals to make the possrep name optional; if a
    generic scalar literal doesn't have an explicit possrep name, it is now
    interpreted as if it had an explicit possrep name that is the empty
    string, which is often the name that possreps have when there is just
    one of them in a scalar type.

    * (Basics.pod)  Introduced a new mnemonic for Muldis D where in some
    contexts the characters "$", "%", "@" specifically represent scalars,
    tuples, relations respectively.  This is useful considering the various
    operators that come in different flavors for tuples/relations, say, but
    have conceptually identical syntax, and need distinguishing actual
    syntax because Muldis D's standard concrete syntaxes won't determine
    which one to use by the types of the arguments.  This particular
    mneumonic is based on Perl, that uses the 3 characters to represent
    scalars/objects, hashes/mappings, and arrays/sequences respectively.
    Also, the mnemonic of doubling some things up to represent relation
    versions where singles of the same are tuple versions, is now gone.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Routines.pod)  Updated the
    concrete syntax for all postcircumfix operators such that the
    tuple-specific and relation-specific versions are now distinguished by
    a leading "%" and "@" respectively, and both use just a single brace
    pair, rather than distinguishing being on a single brace pair versus a
    double one respectively.  So for example, tuple/relation rename() now
    looks like "%{<-}"/"@{<-}" rather than "{<-}"/"{{<-}}".  Similarly, the
    wrap()-concerning and group()-concerning operators are now
    distinguished by using a single "%" and "@" between the braces
    respectively, rather than distinguishing with a single versus a double
    "@".  So for example, relation wrap()/group() now looks like
    "@{%<-}"/"@{@<-}" rather than "{{@<-}}"/"{{@@<-}}".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Routines.pod)  Added special
    alternate syntax for scalar "projection" (extracting a subset of a
    scalar's possrep's attributes as a tuple) as 2 new postcircumfix ops
    "${}", "${!}"; an example of use being "$birthday${date;year,month}".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Routines.pod)  Added special
    alternate syntax for accessing individual scalar possrep and tuple
    attributes, specifically over the 2 "Core.[Scalar|Tuple].attr"
    functions as 2 new postcircumfix ops ".${}" and ".%{}"; examples of use
    are "$birthday.${date;day}" and "$pt.%{city}".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Array.pod)  Added special
    alternate syntax for accessing "Array" elements, either individual
    elements or array slices, specifically over the 2 "Array.[value|slice]"
    functions as 2 new postcircumfix ops ".[]" and "[..]"; examples of use
    are "$ary.[3]" and "$ary[10..14]".

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)
    Updated the "terse pseudo-variable syntax" feature extension of DBMS
    entity names so that it is more restrictive, such that in most
    situations it may now only be used to address attributes of tuple (or
    database) typed entities, and no longer also attributes of scalar
    possreps or relations.  This added restriction is in place for
    practical reasons of Muldis D syntax being more strongly typed, such
    that it is possible to know at parse-time whether each attribute access
    is for a scalar or tuple or relation, and so both it is easier to
    implement Muldis D and easier to understand at a glance what Muldis D
    code is doing, even if the system catalog representation of the code is
    a bit more verbose due to requiring more explicit function calls.  In
    Basics.pod, updated the 2 pod sub-sections "Terse Pseudo-Variable
    Syntax" and "Referencing Data Types".  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated
    the description of the "AccExprNodeSet" catalog type.  In PTMD_STD.pod,
    updated the description of "NameChain_payload" grammar nodes and
    "accessor" grammar nodes; in all 3 STD files, updated the example code
    comments for "accessor" grammar nodes.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  Updates corresponding to recent
    spec changes.

2009-09-02  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.86.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.86.0.tar.gz.

    * (Basics.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin)  Fixed fossils
    from v0.85.0 re '!' usage.

    * (Routines.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin)  Removed "<>"
    as an alternate concrete syntax for "≠"; now only "!=" is an alternate.

    * (HDMD_Perl6_STD.pod, Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul)  In
    accordance with the latest Perl 6 spec (an update on 2009.08.29),
    updated the HDMD_Perl6_STD code examples to reflect that you now use
    "/" to select a Perl 6 "Rat" in terms of 2 "Int", where you used to use
    "div" to do that.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In the "GENERIC VALUE
    EXPRESSIONS" main pod section, made the rules for the "named_expr"
    grammar node more lax such that now it is valid for *any* other "expr"
    node to be named by it, including another "named_expr"; in such a case
    as this, or when naming an "expr_name" node, an "AccExprNodeSet" tuple
    is now defined as what it parses to, and we have a simple node alias.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In the "GENERIC VALUE
    EXPRESSIONS" main pod section, added new pod sub-section "Generic
    Expression Attribute Accessors", featuring the new grammar node
    "accessor", whose initial flavor is "acc_via_named".  This addition is
    part of a grammar refactor that also features the "expr_name" node
    being simplified to just take a "Name" payload, and "acc_via_named" now
    handles the "NameChain" payload that "expr_name" used to handle.  Now
    "expr_name" just references named expression nodes or parameters etc,
    and no longer drills into their attributes; drilling is now just the
    purvue of "accessor".  The refactor also eliminated the distinct
    "decl_expr_name" as "named_expr" now uses "expr_name" instead.  In
    PTMD_STD, the "acc_via_named" grammar is identical to the old
    "expr_name" and so this change is backwards compatible.  However, in
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD, a small backwards-incompatible change was
    introduced, such that the first element of every "accessor" node is
    "$." rather than "$" which "expr_name" uses; but there was no older
    example code which did drilling, so no update was necessary.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  In "Generic Expression
    Attribute Accessors", added new "accessor" grammar node flavor
    "acc_via_anon", which provides the new feature that attributes can now
    be accessed/aliased of anonymous expression nodes (not just explicitly
    named nodes), such as one would expect to be able to do in a
    programming language; for example you can now say "inn.tuple_res_func(
    $arg ).quux_attr" (PTMD_STD).

    * (Types.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Blob.pod)
    Corrected several instances of repeated word typos.

2009-08-29  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.85.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.85.0.tar.gz.

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the "DESCRIPTION" main pod to
    boldface the portion saying one should read the PTMD_STD dialect spec
    first, since readers may gloss over the introduction and not realize
    how essential this is to understanding the Perl-STD dialect specs.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Integer.pod)  The special
    alternate syntax for the integer 'factorial' function is now the 'I!'
    postfix rather than the '!' postfix.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, Routines.pod)  Added special alternate syntax for the
    boolean 'not' function which is the '!' prefix, that complements the 2
    'not', '¬' prefix syntaxes.  This addition should satisfy something
    that many developers would expect to be present, especially since '!'
    is already used as a component of many multi-char operator alternate
    syntaxes to indicate the negation or complement of something.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, Routines.pod, Text.pod)  Added special alternate
    syntax, the infix 'not isa', complementing the infix '!isa'.  Added
    special alternate syntaxes, the infix '!matching', '!like',
    complementing the infix 'not matching', 'not like'.  Also made a few
    other minor PTMD_STD.pod and Routines.pod updates.

2009-08-24  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.84.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.84.0.tar.gz.

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the syntax for "expr_name" and
    "named_expr" nodes so that both they are more terse and they more
    closely resemble the PTMD_STD syntax for the same nodes; the first
    element of each of these nodes is now the character string '$' and
    '::=' respectively, rather than 'expr_name' and 'named_expr'.  The vast
    majority of actual updates were to the code examples using these nodes.

2009-08-20  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.83.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.83.0.tar.gz.

    * This distribution has excised its direct external dependency on the
    "version" module, which had no practical use to begin with.  This
    change has no effect on the version number format of the distribution
    or documentation files.

    * (Routines.pod)  Updated the descriptions of 2 otherwise-unaltered
    functions to add or update notes about alternate names or symbols that
    the function or its operation are known as.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the concept "foreign key" to
    "subset constraint".  One reason is that the new name is more accurate,
    both because it better describes the nature of the constraints (seeing
    if all members of one set are in another set) and since these
    constraints are defined as a type constraint on a nonscalar type, and
    all subjects of the constraint are equally "local".  Another reason is
    so that all remaining uses of the term "foreign" in Muldis D refer to
    entities that are external to the Muldis D language or DBMS
    environment, such as other peer languages or remote DBMSs.  In
    Types_Catalog.pod, renamed the 3 catalog types
    "Foreign[|Distrib]KeySet", "FKChildAttrParentAttrMap" to
    "[|Distrib]SubsetConstrSet", "SCChildAttrParentAttrMap", and updated
    the catalog type "InnerNonscalarType" to rename its 2 attributes
    "foreign_[|distrib_]keys" to "[|distrib_]subset_constraints".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Corrected a mistake in the descriptions of the 2
    catalog types "[|Distrib]SubsetConstrSet" concerning the effect of a
    subset constraint defined over zero relation attributes.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-07-27  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.82.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.82.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed catalog type "AliasExprNodeSet" to
    "AccExprNodeSet" and renamed its "original" attribute to "target"; each
    tuple of this type represents an "accessor" expr node rather than an
    "alias"; also updated the "ExprNodeSet" catalog type to rename its
    "alias_exprs" attribute to "acc_exprs".

    * (Ordered.pod)  Updated the descriptions of 2 otherwise-unaltered
    functions to add or update notes about alternate names or symbols that
    the function or its operation are known as.

    * (Routines.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated each of the 5 functions
    "sys.std.Core.[Tuple|Relation].[|cmpl_]wrap",
    "sys.std.Core.Relation.unwrap" to swap the canonical order of its 2
    "outer", "[|cmpl_]inner" parameters so that the one applying to the
    function's result appears first / on the left.  Likewise with each of
    the 5 functions
    "sys.std.Core.Relation.[|cmpl_|un|[cardinality|count]_per_]group" and
    its 2 "[outer|count_attr_name]", "[inner|group_per]" parameters.  Also
    swapped the canonical order of the 2 attributes of the "AttrRenameMap"
    catalog type so that "after" comes first / on the left, and updated the
    descriptions of the 2 "rename" functions to reflect this change.

    * (Routines.pod)  Updated the "sys.std.Core.Tuple.unwrap" function to
    add a completely superfluous "inner" parameter for no reason other than
    to make parity with the "Relation" flavor of that function (and every
    other wrap/group/un function, where it is actually needed in the
    general case); well that, and it probably helps with
    self-documentation, and with developing normalized concrete syntax.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Fixed a few fossils or other minor errors.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Small grammar refactor; added new grammar node
    "attr_name" which is simply a "Name_payload" and updated the 3 other
    nodes "tuple_list", "r_[empty_body|ordered_attr]_payload" to embed the
    new node rather than directly the old one.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within the main pod section
    "FUNCTION INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS", added new pod
    sub-section "Simple Postcircumfix Operators", which provides
    function-specific concrete syntaxes for 16 more (non-plain-alias)
    functions, each of which having 1 special syntax specific to it.  In
    PTMD_STD, this section introduced the new main node kind
    "postcircumfix_op_invo".  These are the 16 functions represented:
    "sys.std.Core.[Tuple|Relation].rename",
    "sys.std.Core.[Tuple|Relation].[projection|cmpl_proj|[|cmpl_|un]wrap]",
    "sys.std.Core.Relation.[|cmpl_|un|cardinality_per_]group".  The new
    special syntaxes use combinations of these: '{', '}', '<-', '@'.

    * (Routines.pod)  Updated the descriptions of the 16 functions
    mentioned in the previous change item to add notes about alternate
    names or symbols that the function or its operation are known as.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the main pod section "NOTES ON TEXT CHARACTER
    LITERALS" to say that the "@" character is now in use for something, a
    sigil used in wrap/group/etc ops, rather than being unused.

    * (Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul, Routines.pod)  Other small
    updates corresp to recent spec changes; in Routines.pod it is with the
    description for the relational divide function.

2009-07-15  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.81.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.81.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features some refactoring of the system catalog, mainly
    to make it less wide and more deep, which incidentally is what release
    0.78.0 was mainly doing as well.  Benefits of these changes include
    that for any formats of the system catalog that are fully
    unwrapped/ungrouped as a set of relvars with just scalar attributes,
    such as it would likely be when represented by a typical SQL DBMS, the
    catalog might require a few orders of magnitude fewer relvars/tables.
    Less wide and more deep means that what otherwise might be multiple
    relvars/tables with a very similar structure and differing mainly/just
    on their extra foreign-key attributes/columns, are now merged into
    fewer relvars/tables with simple generalizations of said structures.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod)  Merged the catalog types
    for defining depots with those for defining packages to produce common
    catalog types for defining both.  In Types_Catalog.pod, merged the 2
    main pod sections "TYPES FOR DEFINING [DEPOTS AND SUBDEPOTS|PACKAGES]"
    into the 1 main pod section "TYPES FOR DEFINING DEPOTS AND SUBDEPOTS
    AND PACKAGES", and merged the 4 catalog types "[Depot|Package]" and
    "[Dep|Pkg]MaterialSet" into the 2 catalog types "DepotOrPackage" and
    "MaterialSet".  The new "DepotOrPackage" has the same 5 attributes at a
    high level that "Depot" had, a proper superset of the 3 that "Package"
    had, and its 2 "[subdepots|packages]" attributes simply are empty sets
    when defining a package.  The "PackageSet" type was modified to remove
    its "package" attribute, so it is now structurally identical to the
    "SubdepotSet" type, and now just declares the existence of packages not
    their contents.  The new "MaterialSet" type has 6 attributes where the
    old analogous types each had 4; 3 of these are identical between each
    of the 3 old/new types, ["name", "comment", "material"]; 1 of these,
    "is_public" is in both the new and Pkg, and is changed from a "Bool" to
    a "maybe_of.Bool"; 1 of these is the "parent" in Dep and is renamed to
    "subdepot" in the new; "MaterialSet" also has 1 attribute that neither
    of Dep|Pkg had, which is "package", that serves a similar purpose to
    "subdepot" for package materials.  In Routines_Catalog.pod, updated the
    "create_package" procedure to remove its "package" parameter, and made
    some updates to the descriptions of a few related procedures.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Refactored the inner types such that rather than
    embedding special-purpose "InnerFuncBody" associated with implicit
    function headings, they now just make use of actual named inner
    functions with explicit headings, which the inner types refer to by
    declaration name; all of the parts of what was an inner type still must
    have a common (outer) material.  Also deleted the catalog type
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.ConstraintSet", which is no longer useful since
    all constraint functions now have names by virtue of being actual inner
    functions.  The updated 7 catalog types are: "Possrep[|Map]Set",
    "Inner[Scalar|Nonscalar|Union|Restr]Type", "VirtualAttrMapSet".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Split 3 catalog types 2 ways each, with some
    renaming, where the members of each post-split pair are initially
    clones of their original; "NameExprMap" became itself plus
    "IISArgVarMap", "IfThenMap" became "IfThen[Expr|VarStmt]Map",
    "WhenThenMap" became "WhenThen[Expr|VarStmt]Map".  Updated attr types
    of 5 other catalog types to use either of the 5 new type names:
    "[IfElse|GivenWhenDef][Expr|Stmt]NodeSet", "ImpInvoStmtNodeSet".  Given
    that, post the above changes, all of the 6 post-split catalog types
    except "NameExprMap" are used by exactly 1 other type, moved the
    definitions of said 5 post-split types to be just after their users;
    moved them from the "SIMPLE GENERIC NONSCALAR TYPES" main pod section
    to the "TYPES FOR DEFINING INNER ROUTINE BODIES" main pod section.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Fixed all catalog type attributes that held
    names of procedure statement nodes so that the types of said attributes
    are now "Name" rather than "NameChain".  Using a "NameChain" on a
    statement node name never really made sense as it is never referencable
    outside its own lexical context and, unlike the expression node it was
    modelled after, it doesn't represent a value nor have a type so it
    can't be drilled into.  These 8 catalog types had one or more
    attributes so fixed:
    "[Leave|Compound|IfElse|GivenWhenDef|Iterate|Loop]StmtNodeSet",
    "[If|When]ThenVarStmtMap".  Also updated the "IISArgVarMap" type to
    rename its 2 attributes from "[name|expr]" to "[arg|var]".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Refactored the catalog types for defining
    expression nodes so that the ability to drill into an expression node
    or parameter etc value with the "NameChain" shorthand is now restricted
    to being used with just one kind of expression node, and all other
    expression node kinds can now only use "Name" values to reference child
    nodes.  Added new catalog node type "AliasExprNodeSet" for defining
    expression nodes that just alias or drill into attributes of other
    nodes or parameters, and updated the "ExprNodeSet" type to add a new
    "alias_exprs" attribute of the new type.  Then updated these 8 catalog
    types whose attributes held names of expression nodes so that the types
    of said attributes are now "Name" rather than "NameChain":
    "[Set|Ary|Bag]SelExprNodeSet", "[IfElse|GivenWhenDef]ExprNodeSet",
    "[If|When]ThenExprMap", "NameExprMap".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the "TYPES FOR SPECIAL ENTITY
    REFERENCES" main pod section in regards to when two distinct selections
    of "MaterialRef" values would produce identical or distinct values, and
    how currying affects identity.  The new version is more DWIM.

2009-07-06  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.80.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.80.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features the extension of function reference types so
    they also represent pre-bound parameters, which gives Muldis D both
    proper closure support like that of other languages, as well as proper
    currying support like that of other languages.  A consequence of this
    is that all 50+ explicit "assuming" parameters are now removed from the
    system-defined routines that took functional closure arguments, and so
    those routines are now more like corresponding ones in other languages.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the first word of
    the title of the main pod section "FUNCTIONS FOR SPECIAL ENTITY
    REFERENCE DEFAULT VALUES" to "ROUTINES" and added new procedure
    "sys.std.Core.Cat.noop" which has no params and doesn't do anything.
    Updated the "ImpRef" type definition so that a ref to "noop" is its new
    default value (but the default of "UpdRef" is still "assign").

    * (Routines.pod)  Updated the procedure "try_catch" to make the "catch"
    parameter optional, so by default an exception thrown in "try" is
    simply a no-op over all.  Also renamed the 4 parameters
    "[try|catch]_[updating|assuming]" to "[try|catch]_[upd|ro]_args".  Also
    "try_catch" now works like "inp_invo" in how it invokes imperatives;
    each "*args" attribute now maps to a distinct parameter rather than the
    invoked simply having 2 Tuple params named "updating" and "assuming".

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the "ROUTINES" main pod section to say that
    conceptually Muldis D routines actually have 1 or 2 Tuple-typed
    positional params and the named attributes of those Tuple params are
    the named params that the routines officially have; sys-def funcs like
    "func_invo" expose this nature since you pass callee args in a Tuple.

    * (Routines.pod)  Fixed the "func_invo" description to not use the word
    "curried" since that isn't what "func_invo" conceivably does, or at
    least not with the same meaning as any other function doing "curried".

    * (Basics.pod)  Mainly in the "ROUTINES" main pod section of
    Basics.pod, updated all 4 named routine kinds which used to have
    exactly N parameters and one was named "assuming", so to have instead
    at least N-1 parameters and the explicit "assuming" was removed in
    favor of optional normal parameters; said 4 routine kinds are:
    "order_determination", "value_[filter|map|reduction]".  More broadly
    speaking, the concept of "currying", that is using any "assuming"
    parameters that system-defined Muldis D routines may have, is now the
    same as in other common programming languages, where each attribute of
    an "assuming" Tuple will bind to an actual same-named parameter of the
    routine rather than the whole "assuming" binding to a single
    "assuming"-named param.  This change item doesn't include updating the
    descriptions of sys-def routines that use currying, because subsequent
    change items remove the need.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod)  In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the
    "TYPES FOR SPECIAL ENTITY REFERENCES" main pod section to say that
    "MaterialRef" types can now represent more info than a name to invoke,
    but with "FuncRef" it can now also represent runtime-context pre-bound
    parameters, and so a "FuncRef" is now more like a full-blown closure.
    In Routines.pod, added new function "sys.std.Core.Control.curried_func"
    which curries a "FuncRef" to derive another "FuncRef" with fewer
    parameters.  Now to keep things simple, currently imperative routines
    can not be curried; that might be supported in the future if a good way
    can be found for users to curry updateable parameters.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod)  While order_determination
    functions in general can now have 3+ parameters, the ones that are
    baked into scalar root types as their type-default order algorithms
    must instead have exactly 4 parameters, the 4th being a "misc_args"
    tuple; related to this, updated the "sys.std.Core.Scalar.order"
    function to rename its "assuming" parameter to "misc_args".

    * (Tuple.pod)  Updated the order_determination function
    "sys.std.Tuple.order_by_attr_names" to replace its "assuming" parameter
    with an "order_by" parameter, the latter previously having been
    supplied as the sole attribute of the former.

    * (Ordered.pod)  Updated every one of the 12 functions to remove its
    "assuming" parameter.  Any situation where said parameter might have
    been used can now curry the ord-det-func instead; this also means that
    for any customizable scalar type-default ODF, the "func" parameter now
    would have to be explicitly given.

    * (Routines.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod,
    Counted.pod)  Updated every one of the 37 remaining routines with a
    "[|[summ|ord|restr|subst|exten]_]assuming" parameter to remove that
    parameter.  The number of updated routines by file were: 8 in
    Routines.pod, 15 in Relation.pod (2 of those with 2 params each
    removed), 3 in Set.pod, 5 in Array.pod, 2 in Bag.pod, 4 in Counted.pod.

    * (Routines.pod, Bool.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  Demoted the function
    "sys.std.Core.Bool.xor" from the language core into the "Bool"
    extension and it is now named "sys.std.Bool.xor".  Also, any places
    where both "xnor" and "xor" are mentioned, they are now in that order.

    * (Routines.pod, Bool.pod)  Updated the descriptions of 4
    otherwise-unaltered functions to add or update notes about alternate
    names or symbols that the function or its operation are known as.

    * (Routines.pod, Bool.pod)  Added 2 functions
    "sys.std.Core.Bool.[all|any]" which are simple aliases for the 2
    "sys.std.Core.Bool.[and|or]".  Added a complement of 9 new functions (8
    standalone plus 1 alias), all in the "sys.std.Bool.\w+" namespace:
    "not_all", "none", "not_any", "[|not_][one|exactly]", "true", "false".
    All 9 are N-adic, taking a set or bag of Bool inputs; the 2 "exactly"
    also take a NNInt input; the first 7 result in a Bool and the last 2 in
    a NNInt.  The purpose of these 11 new functions is to be the basis for
    easier specification of a variety of common constraints, including
    "existential quantification" and "universal quantification".

    * (Conventions.pod, BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist,
    Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin)  Various minor updates and fixes.

2009-06-16  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.79.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.79.1.tar.gz.

    * Forked the slideshow "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_sa.xul" into
    itself, which remains unchanged, and the new file
    "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul", which has been modified
    just enough to bring it into compliance with all the Muldis D spec
    changes made since release 0.43.0 (when "_sa" was frozen).  The most
    significant improvements in "_updated" is that all the concrete Muldis
    D code examples were rewritten into ones with the same semantics but
    that are actual semi-specced Muldis D code rather than pseudo-code;
    especially prominant is that the new code's size is 80-90% smaller than
    before, and in the examples comparing Muldis D to SQL, the Muldis D
    code was generally just half the size of the SQL code, so being less
    verbose than SQL rather than more.  And so, from now on,
    "Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_updated.xul" will continue to be updated with
    each Muldis D release when it otherwise becomes incorrect, and so it
    should remain one of the best introduction materials to Muldis D.

2009-06-13  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.79.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.79.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Removed the catalog type
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.OrdDetFuncNameChain", which had only been used
    for the first 3 releases of its existence (0.36-38.0), and since
    release 0.39.0 only the "OrdDetFuncRef" type was used instead of it.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Types.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  Added new reference
    root catalog type "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.MaterialRef" and redefined the
    4 existing "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.[Func|OrdDetFunc|Proc|Type]Ref"
    catalog types as enumeration types that are proper subtypes of the new
    one, rather than being distinct root types of their own.  The 4
    redefined types are practically exactly the same as before except that
    the default value of "TypeRef" is now "Universal" rather than "Bool",
    reflecting the default of the "InnerRestrType" and "Material" catalog
    types, and "MaterialRef" also has the same default.  Corresponding to
    the reorg, merged the 4 nonscalar catalog types
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.[Func|OrdDetFunc|Proc|Type]RefSelExprNodeSet"
    into the 1 "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.MaterialRefSelExprNodeSet", and
    merged the corresponding 4 attributes of the "ExprNodeSet" catalog type
    into 1.  Also updated the "special_types" attribute of the "System"
    catalog type to reflect just the "MaterialRef" type and not the 4 old
    reference types that are now its subtypes.  In Types.pod, updated the
    definition of the "Reference" type to say its default value is now
    "Universal", following the "TypeRef" change.  In PTMD_STD.pod, updated
    the "Library Entity Reference Selector" pod sub-section to reflect the
    rearranging of the reference types.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod, Basics.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Renamed the 2 catalog types
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.Proc[Ref|InvoStmtNodeSet]" to the 2
    "Imp[Ref|InvoStmtNodeSet]" since they reference any imperative routine,
    not just a procedure.  Also renamed the "ImpInvoStmtNodeSet" attribute
    "procedure" to "imperative", and renamed the "StmtNodeSet" attribute
    "proc_invo_stmts" to "imp_invo_stmts".  Also renamed the
    "sys.std.Core.Control.proc_invo" procedure to "imp_invo" and renamed
    its "procedure" parameter to "imperative"; this routine also now can
    invoke any imperative, even an updater.  In the STD files, renamed the
    "proc_ref" node kind to "imp_ref".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod)  Added new catalog type
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.UpdRef", a proper subtype of "ImpRef", and
    updated the updater "sys.std.Core.Control.upd_invo" to use it as the
    type of its "updater" parameter.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Corrected examples fossil.

    * (Relation.pod, Array.pod)  Updated each of the 4 functions
    "sys.std.Relation.[rank|limit]",
    "sys.std.Array.[|limit_of_]Array_from_wrap" to change the declared type
    of its "ord_func" parameter from "FuncRef" to "OrdDetFuncRef".

    * (Basics.pod)  In the "ROUTINES" main pod section, some pod
    reformatting where the group of list items was changed to a group of
    pod sub-sections; each list item title became a level-2 pod heading;
    also the text that followed the old list got a level-2 heading of its
    own, "Other Matters".

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod, Set.pod)  In the
    "ROUTINES" main pod section, renamed the routine kind "type_default" to
    "named_value" and made its description more general, though its actual
    structure (any niladic function) is unchanged.  Then updated any
    references to that routine kind.  Then updated the
    "sys.std.Set.Maybe.nothing" function description to explicitly say it
    is a "named_value" function.

    * (Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Types.pod, Basics.pod)  Added 3 new
    "named_value" functions "sys.std.Tuple.d0", "sys.std.Relation.d0c[0|1]"
    which result in all 3 of the nonscalar values with zero attributes,
    which have special names; also tweaked docs about said special names.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Added special literal
    syntax to the "Tuple" and "Relation" node kinds, similar to what exists
    for "Maybe", so the plain barewords "d0", "d0c0", "d0c1" are now
    nonscalar GCVLs by themselves, like "nothing" or "∅" are.  Note that
    this feature is in PTMD_STD alone; the Perl-STD dialects don't have it.

    * (Routines.pod)  Updated the "sys.std.Core.Relation.summary" function
    to make it more standardized relative to other system-defined
    conceptually monadic mapping functions; the function given to its
    "summ_func" parameter must now have a single varying parameter named
    "topic" taking a binary tuple with "summarize" and "per" attributes,
    rather than having 2 varying parameters named "summarize" and "per".

    * (Relation.pod)  Fixed 3 instances of a fossil:  Updated each of the 3
    updaters "assign_subst[itution|_in_[restr|semijoin]]" to add a single
    parameter "[|subst_]attr_names".  The corresponding 3 non-"assign_"
    functions had said parameter added in release 0.59.0 and the 3
    "assign_" updaters should have gained them too, but didn't.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod)  In the
    "ROUTINES" main pod section of Basics.pod, added 3 more routine kinds
    named "value_[filter|map|reduction]", which describe all the kinds of
    closures that system-defined functions take as arguments, besides the
    single generic "func_invo"; each has either a single "topic" parameter
    or a "v1"+"v2" parameter, and each has an "assuming" parameter.  Added
    3 catalog reference types
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.Val[Filt|Map|Red]FuncRef", each of which points
    to just one kind of function.  In Routines_Catalog.pod, added new main
    pod section "FUNCTIONS FOR SPECIAL ENTITY REFERENCE DEFAULT VALUES"
    which defines 3 new catalog functions
    "sys.std.Core.Cat.[[pass|map_to]_topic|reduce_to_v1]" whose main
    purpose is that refs to them are the default values of the 3 new types.

    * (Routines.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod,
    Counted.pod)  Updated 1 or 2 parameters each of 31 routines to change
    each of the parameter's declared types from "FuncRef" to one of the new
    3 kinds.  In 9 routines, replaced 1 param type with "ValFiltFuncRef":
    "sys.std.Core.Relation.[|assign_][restriction|cmpl_restr]",
    "sys.std.Core.Relation.restr_and_cmpl",
    "sys.std.Relation.[|assign_][|static_]subst_in_restr]".  In 14
    routines, replaced 1 param type with "ValMapFuncRef":
    "sys.std.Core.Relation.[|assign_]extension",
    "sys.std.Core.Relation.summary",
    "sys.std.Relation.[classification|map]",
    "sys.std.Relation.[|assign_]subst[itution|_in_[restr|semijoin]]",
    "sys.std.Relation.outer_join_with_exten",
    "sys.std.Counted.counted_[map|substitution]".  In 10 routines, replaced
    1 param type with "ValRedFuncRef":
    "sys.std.[Relation|Set|Array|Bag].[|maybe_]reduction",
    "sys.std.Counted.counted_[|maybe_]reduction".

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Various
    minor updates and fixes.

2009-06-09  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.78.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.78.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a refactoring of the system catalog types and
    routines concerning types for defining "outer" routines and types, such
    that 13 catalog types were merged into 3, and 16 catalog routines were
    merged into 4, and in other types 8 attributes were merged into 2; this
    had the side-effect of making Types_Catalog.pod about 7K lighter, and
    Routines_Catalog.pod about 2K lighter.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Multiple updates of the catalog types for
    defining data types, so to help Muldis D code be less verbose.  With
    the "PossrepSet" type, updated its "constraint" attr's declared type to
    be a Maybe of its prior type; a programmer may now leave that attribute
    undefined, and the semantics are as if they defined a function that
    unconditionally resulted in true.  With the 3 types
    "Inner[Scalar|Nonscalar|Restr]Type", updated each of the total of 4
    attrs "default[|_tuple|_relation]" by changing its declared type to be
    a Maybe of its prior type; a programmer may now leave that attribute
    undefined, and the semantics are as if they either picked the same
    value as the base type, if defining a subtype, or they picked a value
    with all attributes being their declared types' default values, if
    defining a base type.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the main pod section "TYPES FOR DEFINING
    ROUTINE HEADINGS" to "TYPES FOR DEFINING INNER ROUTINE HEADINGS".  Then
    merged the 2 main pod sections "TYPES FOR DEFINING [ROUTINE BODIES|DATA
    TYPES]" into the 1 main pod section "TYPES FOR DEFINING ROUTINES AND
    DATA TYPES" and placed the post-merge section just prior to the renamed
    section.  No changes to the catalog types themselves in this chg item.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Merged the 5 catalog data types
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.[[Func|Upd|Proc]Body|Type|InnerTypeSet]" into
    the 1 catalog data type "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.Material".  The new type
    has a union of all the relation-typed attributes of the 5 old types,
    the 7 "inner_[func|upd|proc|[sca|nonsca|uni|restr]_type]s".  The new
    type also introduces a design change by eliminating the "main_body"
    attribute of the 3 old "Body" types; now, a main routine is always
    represented by an inner routine of the same kind, which must have the
    empty string as its name.  Further to that design change, while the old
    3 types "[Func|Upd|Proc]Body" did not include the definition of the
    main routine's heading and users of them had to pair a "Body" value
    with a corresponding "[Func|Upd|Proc]Body" value, the new "Material"
    internalizes the "Head" and so defines a whole routine sans name
    internally, same as the old "Type" defined a whole type sans name, the
    latter also being what "Material" still does.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated all the other catalog data types that
    embedded the old data types which became "Material" so to use that new
    type instead.  Merged the 8 old data types
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.[Dep|Pkg][Func|Upd|Proc|Type]Set" into the new 2
    data types "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.[Dep|Pkg]MaterialSet"; where each of
    the old types had either the 2 attributes "head"+"body" or the 1
    attribute "type", the new types have just the 1 attribute "material".
    Also updated the 2 data types "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.[Depot|Package]"
    so that in each, their 4 attributes
    "[functions|updaters|procedures|types]" were merged into the 1
    attribute "materials".  Also updated the 1 data type
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.SysTypeSet" to change the declared type of its
    "type" attribute from "Type" to "Material".

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Updated all the catalog routines that worked
    with the old data types which became "Material" so to work with that
    new type instead.  Merged the 16 old procedures in the
    "sys.std.Core.Cat.\w+" namespace named
    "[create|drop]_[depot|package]_[function|updater|procedure|type]" into
    the 4 new "[create|drop]_[depot|package]_material" procedures.

    * (Set.pod, Bag.pod)  Added 4 functions where each is an alias for
    another function.  The 4 "sys.std.[Set|Bag].value_is[|_not]_member"
    alias the 4 "sys.std.[Set|Bag].has[|_not]_member".

    * (Text.pod, Set.pod, Bag.pod)  Updated the descriptions of 6
    otherwise-unaltered functions to add or update notes about alternate
    names or symbols that the function or its operation are known as.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Within the pod sub-section "Simple Non-symmetric
    Dyadic Infix Operators", added function-specific concrete syntaxes for
    8 more functions, having 1 special syntax each: "S∈", "S∉", "S∋", "S∌",
    "B∈", "B∉", "B∋", "B∌"; none of these has a code example.

    * Muldis::D version 0.77.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.77.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a rough cut (that might have introduced a few
    subtle mistakes) of a mass renaming of some Muldis D type categories as
    well as corresponding system-defined maximal types, so to make the
    documentation simpler, easier to understand, and less ambiguous or more
    correct.  It concerns the pairs of concepts or types where one had a
    "quasi-" prefix and the other didn't; the concepts and types with a
    "quasi-" prefix were renamed to lose that prefix and otherwise be the
    same; the counterparts that didn't have the prefix gained a different
    prefix, "dh-", or "deeply homogeneous".  This release makes no changes
    at all to the specified language semantics or features, but just to its
    syntax; what you may actually do is the same as before.  This release
    has no file renames/adds/removes; just changes to file contents.

    * (Routines.pod, Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod,
    PTMD_STD.pod, Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Ordered.pod, Counted.pod)
    Renamed all "sys.std.Core.Q[Scalar|Tuple|Relation].\w+" entities to
    "sys.std.Core.[Scalar|Tuple|Relation].\w+", and all
    "sys.std.Q[Tuple|Relation|Set[|.QMaybe]|Array|Bag].\w+" entities to
    "sys.std.[Tuple|Relation|Set[|.Maybe]|Array|Bag].\w+".  This is a
    simple reversal of part of release 0.54.0.

    * (Types.pod, Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Removed the
    system-defined type "sys.std.Core.Type.Remnant", which is not actually
    useful, and has not actually been in use.  But the concept "remnant
    type" has been retained since it definitely is useful; its just that
    any maximal type specific to remnant types must by necessity have the
    same value set as the "Universal" type, so that can be used anywhere
    "Remnant" would conceivably have been.  Also removed the system-defined
    type "sys.std.Core.Type.ScaTupRel", which hasn't been in use since
    release 0.55.0 made any prior uses of it use "Universal" instead.  In
    Types.pod, removed the main pod section "SYSTEM-DEFINED REMNANT TYPES".
    In Basics.pod, also clarified that every "remnant" type is a proper
    subset of "Universal", not just a subset.

    (Types.pod, Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod, Array.pod,
    Bag.pod, Counted.pod, Ordered.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Rational.pod,
    Temporal.pod, Spatial.pod)  In Types.pod, renamed 16 types, in the
    "sys.std.Core.Type.\w+" namespace: the 8
    "[Scalar|Tuple|Relation|Set|Maybe|Single|Array|Bag]" to
    "DH[Scalar|Tuple|Relation|Set|Maybe|Single|Array|Bag]" and the 8
    "Q[Scalar|Tuple|Relation|Set|Maybe|Single|Array|Bag]" to
    "[Scalar|Tuple|Relation|Set|Maybe|Single|Array|Bag]".  In Basics.pod,
    updated the pod sub-section "Referencing Data Types" to rename the
    "[|quasi_][tuple|relation]_from" typeref syntax to
    "[|dh_][tuple|relation]_from" and the
    "[|quasi_][set|maybe|single|array|bag]_of" typeref syntax to
    "[|dh_][set|maybe|single|array|bag]_of".  In all 19 files,
    correspondingly updated all references to those types and uses of those
    typeref syntaxes.  In the 3 STD.pod files, updated all the "value_kind"
    that corresponded to the renamed types, renaming them likewise.  During
    these changes, many references to the prefixless versions of the types,
    mainly in system-defined routine signatures, and in example code,
    remained prefixless to maintain simpler syntax, and so in appearance
    became more generic, though in actuality were still as specific as
    before; for example, "bag_of.Int" is in fact just as restrictive as
    "dh_bag_of.Int" since the "Int" is a scalar type; the extra "dh_" only
    makes an actual difference with nonscalar element types.

    * (Basics.pod)  Multiple updates to the "TYPE SYSTEM" main pod section.
    For each of "scalar","tuple","relation","nonscalar",etc as "foo",
    renamed each "foo" concept to "deeply homogeneous foo", and each
    "quasi-foo" concept to "foo", and updated the related documentation to
    be more readable.  Most changes were in the "Type Identification" and
    "Distinction of Non-Homogeneous Types from Homogeneous Types" pod
    sub-sections; the latter was renamed from "Distinction of Quasi- Types
    from Non-Quasi Types".  Also an old phrase in the "Distinction ..."
    section, "only non-quasi types can be interpreted according to the
    relational model, as predicates and prepositions", turned out to be
    rather incorrect, and has been excised; this problem is in fact part of
    the rationale for the whole renaming this release features.  However, a
    Muldis D "database" is still as strict as before, only allowing deeply
    homogeneous relations as content, since that's much more practical.

    * (Types.pod, Routines.pod, Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod,
    Array.pod, Bag.pod, Basics.pod)  Renamed any main pod sections with
    "QUASI-/" in their names to remove that text, and renamed any pod
    sub-sections with "Q/" in their names to remove that text.

    * (Routines.pod, Tuple.pod, Set.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod, Relation.pod)
    Related to the previous changes, to make their names more accurate, 18
    routines were renamed from
    ["sys.std.Core.Scalar.[QTuple_from_QScalar|QScalar_from_QTuple]",
    "sys.std.Core.Relation.[QTuple_from_QRelation|QRelation_from_QTuple]",
    "sys.std.Tuple.[attr_from_QTuple|QTuple_from_attr]",
    "sys.std.Set.QSet_from_[wrap|attr]",
    "sys.std.Array.[|limit_of_]QArray_from_wrap[|_by_attr_names]",
    "sys.std.Array.QArray_from_attr", "sys.std.Bag.QSet_from_QBag",
    "sys.std.Bag.QBag_from_[QSet|wrap|cmpl_group|attr]"] to the same names
    but lacking any "Q".  This is a reversal of part of release 0.55.0.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod,
    Routines_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, Conventions.pod, Ordered.pod,
    Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod, Counted.pod)
    Since the prefixless types are now the supertypes, purged all instances
    of "q/" used before various terms like "scalar" or "tuple"; outside of
    titles, there seem to have been about 768 of them.

2009-06-04  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.76.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.76.1.tar.gz.

    * This release has the first step of renaming some Muldis D type
    categories as well as corresponding system-defined maximal types, so to
    make the documentation simpler, easier to understand, and less
    ambiguous or less correct; it concerns the pairs of concepts or types
    where one has a "quasi-" prefix and the other doesn't.  The primary
    change now is renaming some files, but otherwise leaving related
    changes minimal; the main changes will be done in the next release, so
    that it would be easy to diff the important changes without having to
    deal with the complexity of simultaneous file name changes.

    * (Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod, D.pm,
    Core.pod, README)  Renamed the 5 files [QTuple.pod, QRelation.pod,
    QSet.pod, QArray.pod, QBag.pod] to remove the 'Q' prefix.  Updated all
    other distro files that referred to the old file names so they refer to
    the new ones instead.  This is a simple reversal of part of rel 0.54.0.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Missed a few updates in the last release.

2009-06-04  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.76.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.76.0.tar.gz.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the pod sub-section "Terse Pseudo-Variable
    Syntax" to clarify that entity names for referencing q/scalar
    attributes must drill down through an explicitly named possrep; also
    that a q/scalar possrep may be referenced directly as if it were a
    q/tuple pseudo-variable.

    * (Blob.pod, Text.pod, QArray.pod)  Renamed the 3 routines
    "sys.std.[Blob|Text|QArray].repeat" to "replication".

    * (QSet.pod)  Updated each of the 2 functions
    "sys.std.QSet.QMaybe.attr_or_[default|value]" to make it N-adic rather
    than dyadic; updated the "topic" parameter to make it a
    "quasi_array_of.QMaybe" rather than a "QMaybe" (and to make it
    optional), and so now the function can now look in any number of QMaybe
    values for a value to result in before falling back to the default,
    rather than just one.  And so the "value" function is now like SQL's
    N-adic COALESCE rather than the dyadic version.

    * (Routines.pod, QSet.pod)  Updated the descriptions of 8
    otherwise-unaltered functions to add or update notes about alternate
    names or symbols that the function or its operation are known as.

    * (Routines.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, QRelation.pod, Counted.pod)
    Some POD reformatting:  Updated every routine signature having a param
    "FooType $bar_param" with a linebreak between the paired type name and
    param name so that each pair is entirely on one line.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the "NameChain" node
    payload definition to add a fourth special case where the chain may be
    abbreviated, which is that with "lex.topic.attr.etc" chains, the
    "topic" may be omitted and the whole chain be prefixed by a period, so
    that ".attr.etc" means the same thing.  And so common kinds of code
    like SQL's "WHERE foo > 1 AND bar < 10" can be written using "$.foo > 1
    and $.bar < 10" rather than "$topic.foo > 1 and $topic.bar < 10".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within the pod sub-section
    "Generic If-Else Expressions", added alternate syntax so that you now
    have a choice to spell your "(if $foo then $bar else $baz)" using the
    same format "($foo ?? $bar !! $baz)" as the Perl 6 conditional op.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within the pod sub-section
    "Simple Non-commutative N-adic Infix Reduction Operators", added
    function-specific concrete syntaxes for 2 more functions, having 1
    special syntax each: "//", "//d"; both have a code example.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within the pod sub-section
    "Simple Non-symmetric Dyadic Infix Operators", added function-specific
    concrete syntaxes for 7 more functions, having 1 special syntax each:
    "isa", "!isa", "as", "asserting", "Bx", "Tx", "Ax"; every one but the
    "Bx", "Ax" has a code example.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within the pod sub-section
    "Simple Monadic Prefix Operators", added function-specific concrete
    syntaxes for 5 more functions, having 1 special syntax each: "d", "t",
    "r", "s", "v"; each one has a code example.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-28  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.75.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.75.0.tar.gz.

    * (Routines.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod, Rational.pod,
    QRelation.pod, QSet.pod, QArray.pod, QBag.pod, Counted.pod,
    Temporal.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, Basics.pod)  Renamed these 60 routines to
    terser versions of themselves (and with no changes to their namespaces)
    mainly for the purpose of making them easier to type:
    "sys.std.Core.QScalar.cmpl_projection" -> "cmpl_proj",
    "sys.std.Core.Q[Tuple|Relation].[|assign_]cmpl_projection"
    -> "[|assign_]cmpl_proj",
    "sys.std.Core.Q[Tuple|Relation].[|assign_]static_extension"
    -> "[|assign_]static_exten",
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.[|assign_]disjoint_insertion"
    -> "[|assign_]disjoint_ins",
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.restriction_and_cmpl" -> "restr_and_cmpl",
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.[|assign_]cmpl_restriction"
    -> "[|assign_]cmpl_restr",
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.[|assign_][|semi]difference"
    -> "[|assign_][|semi]diff",
    "sys.std.Integer.[inc|dec]rement" -> "[inc|dec]",
    "sys.std.[Integer|Rational].[|abs_]difference" -> "[|abs_]diff",
    "sys.std.Integer.[|maybe_]quotient_and_remainder"
    -> "[|maybe_]quot_and_rem",
    "sys.std.Blob.length_in_[bits|octets]" -> "len_in_[bits|octets]",
    "sys.std.Text.length_in_[nfd_codepoints|graphemes]"
    -> "len_in_[nfd_codes|graphs]",
    "sys.std.Text.case_folded_to_[upper|lower]" -> "[upper|lower]",
    "sys.std.Text.whitespace_trimmed" -> "trim",
    "sys.std.Text.is[|_not]_match_using_like" -> "is[|_not]_like",
    "sys.std.QRelation.transitive_closure" -> "tclose",
    "sys.std.QRelation.[|assign_]static_substitution"
    -> "[|assign_]static_subst",
    "sys.std.QSet.disjoint_insertion" -> "disjoint_ins",
    "sys.std.QArray.has[|_not]_element" -> "has[|_not]_elem",
    "sys.std.QBag.difference" -> "diff",
    "sys.std.Counted.counted_cmpl_projection" -> "counted_cmpl_proj",
   "sys.std.Counted.counted_static_substitution" -> "counted_static_subst",
    "sys.std.Counted.counted_difference" -> "counted_diff",
    "sys.std.Temporal.[|UTC|Float]Instant.[|abs_]difference"
    -> "[|abs_]diff",
    "sys.std.Temporal.[|UTC]Duration.difference" -> "diff",
    "sys.std.Temporal.Instant.fetch_current_instant"
    -> "fetch_curr_instant",
   "sys.std.Temporal.[UTC|Float]Instant.fetch_current_[datetime|date|time]"
    -> "fetch_curr_[datetime|date|time]".

    * (Types.pod)  Updated the "Text" type to rename its 1 possrep from
    "nfd_codepoints" to "nfd_codes", for consistency with the prior change.

    * (Routines.pod)  Updated the "sys.std.Core.STDIO.read_Text" routine to
    renam its "length_in_graphemes" param to "len_in_graphs", as per above.

    * (Routines.pod)  Added new "sys.std.Core.QRelation.count_per_group"
    function which is a simple alias for "cardinality_per_group".

    * (Text.pod)  Updated the 2 functions "is[|_not]_like" to explicitly
    make the "escape" parameter optional; this was an omission from before.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Within the pod sub-section "Simple Non-symmetric
    Dyadic Infix Operators", added function-specific concrete syntaxes for
    2 more functions, having 1 special syntax each: "like", "not like";
    these don't have associated code examples yet though.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Other minor updates.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-27  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.74.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.74.0.tar.gz.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new main pod section "NOTES ON TEXT CHARACTER
    LITERALS", just following "NOTES ON TERMINOLOGY", which enumerates all
    the characters used (or will be) literally anywhere in the Muldis D
    spec, or specifically in the concrete syntax specs, along with their
    Unicode character names and a brief description of their use.  This is
    so that it is easier to recognize said characters when they are seen,
    especially since the Unicode standard includes many cases of distinct
    characters that visually are nearly identical, so you know
    unambiguously what characters the Muldis D spec is actually referring
    to.  The initial list includes all 94 visible 7-bit ASCII chars plus
    'space' plus 41 trans-ASCII characters with known uses plus 11
    trans-ASCII characters not currently in use but being mentioned since
    some of those might be used later or to say why they're not in use.

    * Added new file "util/Input_Method_Muldis_D.cin" which is the first
    cut of a generic-format "input method" plugin, that can be installed
    as-is under various operating systems including Mac OS X 10.5, whose
    use should make it much easier to type the various trans-ASCII symbols
    that the Muldis D concrete syntaxes allow you to use for operators/etc.
    Of course, you might already have some other "input method" tool to use
    already that helps with mathematical/etc symbols so the one bundled
    with the Muldis D spec may be redundant; but otherwise it should help.
    To use it in Mac OS X, simply drop it in your "~/Library/Input Methods"
    and log out plus log in and enable it in the "International" System
    Preference panel.  Also updated "util/README" about this file.

    * (Routines.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod, QRelation.pod,
    Temporal.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the
    documentation in general to use more correct terminology with respect
    to symmetric dyadic functions, so that it now calls each a "symmetric
    function" rather than a "function with 2 mutually commutative main
    parameters", or added said note in the first place.  The descriptions
    of these 10 functions were thusly updated:
    "sys.std.Core.Universal.is[|_not]_identical",
    "sys.std.[Integer|Rational].abs_difference",
    "sys.std.QRelation.[is[|_not]_disjoint|composition]",
    "sys.std.Temporal.[|UTC|Float]Instant.abs_difference".  In all 3 STD
    files, renamed the 2 pod sub-sections "Simple [C|Non-c]ommutative
    Dyadic Infix Operators" to "Simple [S|Non-s]ymmetric Dyadic Infix
    Operators" and otherwise updated them; also renamed all syntax nodes
    containing "[|non]comm_dyadic" to replace that with "[|non]sym_dyadic".

    * (Routines.pod, Ordered.pod, Blob.pod)  Annotated any N-adic functions
    that previously were directly described with "commutative and
    associative" to now also say "idempotent" when the main inputs were
    supplied as a q/set argument and not a q/bag.  These 7 functions were
    thusly annotated: "sys.std.Core.Bool.[and|or]",
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.[union|intersection|join]",
    "sys.std.Ordered.min", "sys.std.Blob.and".  Now more functions than
    these are idempotent, but their descriptions say "like function foo".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated
    the "RatRoundRule" type definition to make it a (non-ordered) scalar
    type (with a single empty-string-name possrep) rather than a tuple
    type; the type is otherwise unchanged, having the same attributes and
    interpretation etc.  As a corresponding change in all STD dialects, the
    attributes of a "RatRoundRule" node are now defined at compile time
    rather than at runtime; they are now "Int" or "RatRoundMeth" node
    payloads rather than being generic "expr" nodes, and so, a
    "RatRoundRule" node is now a "opaque_value_literal" rather than a
    "coll_value_selector"; if you want to define a "RatRoundRule" at
    runtime, you must now use a "Scalar" node to do it instead.  In the STD
    dialects, renamed the "Rational Rounding Rule Selectors" pod
    sub-section to "Rational Rounding Rule Literals" and moved it upwards.

    * (Routines.pod, QSet.pod, QBag.pod, Counted.pod, QArray.pod, Text.pod,
    Blob.pod)  Renamed each of the 18
    "is[|_not]_[member|element|subarray|substr[|_bits|_octets]]" functions
    to "has[|_not]_[member|element|subarray|substr[|_bits|_octets]]" so
    that if the function's name was used infix then it would read correctly
    with the canonical order of its 2 primary parameters.

    * (Routines.pod, QRelation.pod, QBag.pod, Counted.pod)  Updated each of
    the 12 "is[|_not][|_proper]_subset" functions so that the canonical
    sequence of its 2 primary parameters is reversed, so that if the
    function's name was used infix then it would read correctly; also
    renamed said 2 main parameters so that "look_for" is now "topic" and
    "look_in" is now "other".

    * (Routines.pod, QRelation.pod, QBag.pod, Counted.pod)  Added 12
    functions where each is an alias for another function save that its 2
    primary arguments are transposed.  The 12
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.is[|_not]_superset" and
    "sys.std.QRelation.is[|_not]_proper_superset" and
    "sys.std.QBag.is[|_not][|_proper]_superset" and
    "sys.std.Counted.counted_is[|_not][|_proper]_superset" complement 12
    "subset".

    * (Ordered.pod)  Renamed the "is_not_before" function to
    "is_after_or_same".  Added the 2 new functions "is_after",
    "is_before_or_same", which are aliases for "is_before",
    "is_after_or_same" save that their 2 primary arguments are transposed.

    * (Types.pod, QSet.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  The special value "nothing" is
    now also known by the extra names "empty set" and "∅"; the latter can
    appear literally in code and the former is just descriptive.  The
    Perl-Hosted dialects don't use ∅ as usually Perl undef denot the value.

    * (Types.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl5_STD.pod)  The 2 boolean values
    "false" and "true" can now alternately be written out in code as
    "⊥" or "⊤" respectively; alternate descriptive names for
    those 2 values are "contradiction" and "tautology" respectively.  The
    HDMD_Perl5_STD dialect was not updated since Perl 6 has a native Bool
    type, which is the only allowed way to denote a Bool literal.

    * (Routines.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, Ordered.pod, Integer.pod,
    Blob.pod, Text.pod, Rational.pod, QRelation.pod, QArray.pod, QBag.pod)
    Updated the descriptions of 59 functions to add or update notes about
    alternate names that the function or its operation are known as, in
    particular adding the various math/etc symbols they represent.

    * (Routines.pod, QRelation.pod)  Added 6 functions where each is an
    alias for another function.  The 2
    "sys.std.Core.QTuple.is[|_not]_member" alias the 2
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.has[|_not]_member".  The 3
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.[count|[|assign_]antijoin]" alias the 3
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.[cardinality|[|assign_]semidifference]".  The 1
    "sys.std.QRelation.symmetric_diff" aliases the 1
    "sys.std.QRelation.exclusion".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated "Comment" literals in a few ways.  A
    "Comment" GCVL may no longer omit its "value_kind"; this is to help
    distinguish comment literals intended to be actual data (these have the
    "value_kind") from those intended to be metadata for other code (these
    are SCVLs and still lack the "value_kind").  Whitespace between comment
    payload segments is now mandatory rather than optional.  A payload
    segment may now be just a run of 2+ hash-marks, in order that one can
    simply use them for visual dividing lines in the code.  Also added note
    to be careful since hash-marks may hav other uses in PTMD_STD code now.

    * Added new file "lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Bool.pod" which houses the new
    "Muldis D Bool Extension".  This extension defines extra operators for
    boolean logic, adding to the minimum few defined in the language core.
    This file has an initial complement of 9 new functions (7 standalone
    plus 2 aliases), all in the "sys.std.Bool.\w+" namespace: "nand",
    "nor", "xnor"/"iff", "imp"/"implies", "nimp", "if", "nif".  (The 4 ones
    in the core that these supplement are: "not", "and", "or", "xor".)  The
    "xnor"/"iff" op is N-adic/commutative while all the other new ops are
    dyadic; of the latter, "nand" and "nor" are symmetric, and the others
    aren't.  And so, now all 2 niladic, 4 monadic, 16 dyadic boolean logic
    operators are directly represented in Muldis D somehow.

    * (D.pm, Core.pod, README)  Added basic references to the new Bool.pod
    file.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Added a couple "INFORMATION SOURCES" items, which are
    about the boolean logic operators.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  In the "GENERIC VALUE EXPRESSIONS" main pod section,
    changed the spelling of the "infix_bind_op" from "=" to "::=".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within mainly the "FUNCTION
    INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS" main pod section, renamed the
    2 is/not-equal infix operators from "===", "!===" to "=", "≠"
    respectively.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Within the "Simple Commutative N-adic Infix Reduction
    Operators" pod sub-section, changed the meaning of the relational op
    spelled "R*" so that it now means "intersection" rather than "join".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within the "FUNCTION
    INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS" main pod section, added one or
    more aliases / alternate spellings of the N operators whose original
    spellings were these: "≠", "and", "or", "xor", "not", "R+", "R*", "R-",
    "R/".  With the not-equal op and the 4 boolean ops, the original
    spellings remained as the main spellings; with the 4 relational ops,
    one of the new spellings became the main: "∪", "∩", "∖", "÷".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within 4 of the existing pod
    sub-sections of the main pod section "FUNCTION INVOCATION ALTERNATE
    SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS", added function-specific concrete syntaxes for 25
    more (non-plain-alias) functions; each of those functions had between 1
    and 4 special syntaxes specific to it, most just 1 or 2.  This
    consisted of 7 boolean functions and 18 relational functions.  Also
    added 1 example each for 3 of the newly treated functions; the other 22
    don't have examp specif to them, but they are th same format as others.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within the main pod section
    "FUNCTION INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS", added new pod
    sub-section "Order Comparison Operators", which provides
    function-specific concrete syntaxes for 9 more (non-plain-alias)
    functions; 5 of those functions had 1 special syntax specific to it, 2
    had 2 each, and 2 had 7 each.  In PTMD_STD, this section introduced the
    new main node kind "ord_compare_op_invo".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Other minor updates.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-19  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.73.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.73.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod, Types.pod, Text.pod, PTMD_STD.pod,
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the "UCPString" type definition (and
    consequently "Text"/etc) so it excludes the special/abnormal/UTF-16
    "surrogate" codepoints between F;D800 and F;DFFF inclusive, and so now
    just includes the complementary ranges within zero and 0x10FFFF
    inclusive.  Also updated any references to "codepoint" in the language
    spec to specify "abstract codepoint" instead, which is more specific.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the infinite number of "String.*" types
    so that their unqualified names are just spelled out with sequences
    delimited base-10 integer literals rather than with essentially their
    own native values.  Then updated the "Name" type so it now has the same
    character repertoire as "Text" or "Comment"; its sole possrep attribute
    is now a "UCPString" rather than a "String".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the "Name" and "Comment" types so that
    now each is a thin wrapper over the "Text" type rather than over the
    "UCPString" type.  The main consequence of this change is that now all
    system-defined character string types can be used with the operators
    defined for the "Text" type, and also that any future enhancements to
    the "Text" type itself or its operators are also shared by the other
    character string types.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Text.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the Muldis D
    concept of a character string, which used to be simply a sequence of
    Unicode codepoints, so it is both more restricted and more abstract at
    the same time.  Updated the "Text" type so that its codepoint string
    must now be in canonical decomposed normal form (NFD); a consequence of
    this is that two character strings will now generally match at the
    grapheme abstraction level, which is more user friendly than the old
    behaviour, especially since the actual codepoints used to build a
    grapheme is typically an implementation detail they don't control.  Now
    also the possrep of "Text" was renamed from "codepoints" to
    "nfd_codepoints".  In Text.pod, renamed the "length_in_codepoints"
    function to "length_in_nfd_codepoints" and deleted the 2 functions
    "folded_to_NF[C|D]" which are now meaningless.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within the main pod section
    "COLLECTION VALUE SELECTORS", added new pod sub-section "Rational
    Rounding Rule Selectors", which declares syntax specific to selecting
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.RatRoundRule" values, which may be used a lot in
    value expressions involving rational numbers.  In PTMD_STD, this
    section introduced these new 2 main ("value") node kinds:
    "RatRoundRule[|_payload]".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within the main pod section
    "FUNCTION INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS", normalized the
    basic format of "func_invo_alt_syntax"/"op" nodes.  In PTMD_STD this
    was just a documentation/concept update, while in both Perl-STD this
    was an actual design change.  In both Perl-STD, all kinds of op nodes
    have exactly 3-4 ordered elements rather than 3-N; previously the 3rd+
    elements were the op args, and now the 3rd element is an array of
    main/mandatory op args and the 4th is a hash of extra/optional ones;
    the dyadic op code examples were updated as approp; N-adic were unch.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Refactored the grammar by
    splitting the 2 pod sub-sections ["Infix N-adic Reduction Operators",
    "Infix Homogeneous Dyadic Operators"] into the 4 pod sub-sections
    ["Simple [C|Non-c]ommutative N-adic Infix Reduction Operators", "Simple
    [C|Non-c]ommutative Dyadic Infix Operators"].  Correspondingly, in
    PTMD_STD, the 2 main node kinds "infix_[reduce|h_dyadic]_op_invo" were
    split into the 4 main node kinds
    "[|non]comm_[infix_reduce|dyadic_infix]_op_invo".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added 2 more
    function-specific concrete syntaxes to the existing pod sub-section
    "Simple Commutative Dyadic Infix Operators".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Within the main pod section
    "FUNCTION INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS", added 3 more pod
    sub-sections ["Simple Monadic P[re|ost]fix Operators", "Rational
    Operators That Do Rounding"].  The additions provide 11 more
    function-specific concrete syntaxes.  In PTMD_STD, these sections
    introduced these new 3 main node kinds: "monadic_p[re|ost]fix_op_invo",
    "rat_op_invo_with_round".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updates corresp to recent spec changes.

2009-05-15  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.72.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.72.0.tar.gz.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Corrected the "[|d_]utc_duration_body" tokens so that
    their 6th (rational) element was optional and had a leading comma.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod)  Added a comment paragraph to each
    of the "BagSelExprNodeSet" type definition and the "Bag" grammar node
    definition, to clarify that any explicit "count" values a programmer
    writes are compile-time constants, and if they want "count" values to
    be determinable at runtime, they'll have to use a "RelSelExprNodeSet"
    tuple or "Relation" node to specify the q/bag value selection instead.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Reverse-refactored the grammar so that minor
    separator or delimiter tokens were merged into the places that used
    them, generally making the latter less verbose and easier to understand
    at a glance; arguably the extra semantic information gotten from naming
    these tokens was trivial and didn't need to be spelled out.  The
    eliminated distinct tokens were these 13: "term_sep",
    "value_[node|payload]_elem_sep", "segment_sep", "name_chain_elem_sep",
    "[list|pair]_elem_sep", "[[|non]ord|param]_list_[open|close]".  Then
    following those changes, cleaned up any superfluous "\w+".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added new main pod section
    "FUNCTION INVOCATION ALTERNATE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS" with the initial 2
    pod sub-sections ["Infix N-adic Reduction Operators","Infix Homogeneous
    Dyadic Operators"].  In PTMD_STD, these sections introduced these new 3
    main node kinds: "func_invo_alt_syntax", "infix_reduce_op_invo",
    "infix_h_dyadic_op_invo".  The additions provide an initial complement
    of 23 special concrete syntaxes for invoking some functions, for
    example allowing one to invoke the typical mathematical operators using
    infix notation rather than the normal prefix notation of "func_invo".

    * (HDMD_Perl5_STD.pod, BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Other minor updates.

2009-05-14  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.71.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.71.0.tar.gz.

    * (Basics.pod)  Corrected the "Referencing Data Types" pod subsection
    of "ENTITY NAMES" so that the "type.type." namespace prefix only is
    used to reference attributes of directly referenceable types, and it is
    not used to simply reference a directly referenceable type.  Also
    clarified that the "type." top level namespace *is* used when
    "tuple_from."/etc or "array_of."/etc are used and
    "[var|type|func_result|param]." is not used.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the "NameChain" node payload definition to
    add a third special case where the chain may be abbreviated, which is
    that with "type." chain prefixes, the prefix-leading "type" element may
    be omitted when the chain prefix contains a "tuple_from."/etc or
    "array_of."/etc, since the latter's presence keeps things unambiguous.

    * (Integer.pod)  Updated the "sys.std.Integer.power" function so that
    zero raised to the power of zero is no longer considered a failure but
    rather results in 1, which seems reasonable given that this specific
    function strictly has no numeric continuity (unlike "Rational.power")
    and that this is by far the most common practice in both pure integer
    math contexts and computer languages, including SQL.

    * (Rational.pod)  Updated the "sys.std.Rational.power" function to add
    a "round_rule" parameter; this is a correction since it was previously
    assumed that "power" with rational arguments would have a rational
    result in the general case, which was wrong (take 2 ^ 0.5 for example).

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Updated the main pod section
    "GENERIC VALUE EXPRESSIONS" with the new main node kind "named_expr",
    which lets you give an explicit name to an "expr" node (that can then
    be referenced with an "expr_name" node).

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Partially reformatted the grammar with a new syntax
    that is a hybrid between the Perl 6 rules used before and EBNF with
    further changes.  There are exactly 2 main differences from before. The
    first is that all explicit capturing syntax is gone (the parenthesis
    that is).  The second is that a token is now declared as "<footok> ::=
    ..." rather than "token footok { ... }"; the actual ... is unchanged
    save for the previous sentence.  Also rewrote the second half of the
    "GENERAL STRUCTURE" main pod section (format explanation) accordingly,
    also adding more information on how tokens and capture nodes relate.

2009-05-11  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.70.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.70.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features large new additions to all 3 bundled dialects,
    such that the entire generic concrete syntax for Muldis D value
    expressions is now specified, and not just the syntax for literals.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Fixed a fossil in the description of the
    "namespaces" attribute of the "System" catalog type: "DeclNameChain"
    value literals no longer have leading and trailing periods.

    * (Routines.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod,
    Rational.pod, QArray.pod, Temporal.pod)  Updated all the simpler
    system-defined (N-ary) reduction operators, specifically those
    functions that can succeed in all cases with zero input values, so to
    make their only parameter optional; when such a function is invoked
    with no explicit argument, the result is the same as if it were given
    an explicit empty list argument, and so the result of an invocation
    with no argument is the function's identity value.  The 15 functions so
    updated are: "sys.std.Core.Bool.[and|or|xor]",
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.[join|product]",
    "sys.std.Core.Cat.Order.reduction",
    "sys.std.[Integer|Rational].[sum|product]",
    "sys.std.[Blob|Text|QArray].catenation",
    "sys.std.Temporal.[|UTC]Duration.sum".

    * (Routines.pod)  Added new function
    "sys.std.Core.Universal.is_not_value_of_type" which is a simple
    complement to the existing "is_value_of_type" function.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Added new main pod section
    "GENERIC VALUE EXPRESSIONS" with the initial 4 pod sub-sections
    ["Generic Function Invocation Expressions", "Generic If-Else
    Expressions", "Generic Given-When-Default Expressions", "Library Entity
    Reference Selector"].  In PTMD_STD, these sections introduced these new
    6 main node kinds: "expr", "expr_name", "func_invo_expr",
    "if_else_expr", "given_when_def_expr", "lib_entity_ref_selector".  The
    additions round out the entire generic concrete syntax for Muldis D
    value expressions, when added to all the kinds of "value" nodes that
    the grammars had before.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Other minor updates.

2009-05-08  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.69.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.69.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Fixed a fossil in the description of the
    "namespaces" attribute of the "System" catalog type where mention of
    the 2 namespaces "tpc" and "tpc.cat" had been omitted.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Corrected the "bootloader" grammar token, which
    didn't have whitespace between its elements; added new token
    "term_sep", which indicates mandatory whitespace.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the "Value Literal Common Elements" pod
    subsection to add a description on how a "type_name" element of a
    "value" node is interpreted depending on context.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Took what used to be the
    "auto_unabbrev_std_names" pragma and made it into standard behaviour,
    also eliminating that pragma in the process.  Updated the "NameChain"
    node payload definition so it now may have as few as 1 element rather
    than as few as 2.  As per the old pragma, now any name chains for
    invoking system-defined types and routines can be written typically as
    its unqualified short name, eg "Int" for "sys.std.Core.Type.Int", and
    it would be unambiguously expanded by the parser.  The Muldis D spec
    itself had been using such abbreviations for a long time, but now that
    practice has been formally specified.  As a new further expansion of
    this feature, now any name chains for invoking named value expressions
    or variables etc can have any leading "lex." element omitted, and it
    would be unambiguously re-added by the parser.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Eliminated a fossil which is
    the "auto_chains_from_names" pragma; this hasn't actually been useful
    for awhile now.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  Eliminated the last pragma,
    "auto_add_attrs", since its usefulness is now questionable; however,
    that functionality might return in the future, maybe with alterations,
    or perhaps better as a feature in the system catalog itself.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  A bit of grammar refactoring:
    Split "Tuple and Database Selectors" 2 ways into "Tuple Selectors" and
    "Database Selectors".  Split the 2 "QTuple[|_payload]" nodes into
    themselves and the 2 new "Database[|_payload]".

    * (Basics.pod, [Types|Routines]_[|Catalog].pod, QBag.pod, SeeAlso.pod,
    INSTALL)  Corrected several instances of repeated word typos.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Other minor fixes.

2009-05-06  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.68.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.68.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features the renaming of all the bundled Muldis D
    dialects/grammars from "_Tiny" to "_STD", which seems more appropriate
    now.  Renamed the 3 files "[PTMD|HDMD_Perl[6|5]]_Tiny.pod" to
    "[PTMD|HDMD_Perl[6|5]]_STD.pod".  Updated any references in these other
    files to reflect the new dialect names: README, D.pm, Basics.pod,
    Types.pod, BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist.

    * (Basics.pod, HDMD_Perl5_STD.pod)  Other minor fixes.

2009-05-04  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.67.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.67.0.tar.gz.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Simplified the grammar so it doesn't do work that
    could just as easily be, or would better be, done after the early
    parsing stage that the grammar describes.  Simplified the 2
    "[UTC|Float]Instant_payload" tokens so they simply alias the
    "UTCDuration_payload"; all 3 now simply look for a sequence of 5
    integers followed by a rational, rather than restricting to integers
    that are specifically non-negative or positive.  Then deleted the 6
    now-unused tokens "[[|d_][nn[int|rat]|utc_instant]_body".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny.pod)  Updated the grammar for
    language name literals to make the 5th/extensions part optional; you no
    longer have to have an explicit empty list when you're using defaults.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny.pod)  Updated the grammar for
    "RatRoundMeth" value literals so that it may now have a "type_name"
    element like most value literals (all but "Bool" and "Order").

    * (Types.pod)  In Types.pod, deleted the singleton data type "Nothing"
    as it no longer seems useful to have singleton data types that are not
    root types.  Then updated the description of the "Maybe" data type to
    say that its sole value with zero elements is now also known by the
    special name "Maybe:nothing", aka "nothing".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny.pod)  Updated all Muldis D
    dialects so to merge the 2 value node kinds of "Single" and "Nothing"
    into the single new kind "Maybe", which provides the new terse means to
    select "Maybe" values.  The syntax for "Maybe" is the same as "Single"
    was, save for the keyword "Maybe" replacing "Single", and also that new
    syntax is added for selecting the value "nothing".  In PTMD_Tiny, the
    syntax "Maybe:{...}" means a "Single" value and "Maybe:nothing" means
    the "nothing" value; also the latter may now be spelled with an omitted
    "value_kind" like "Int" nodes et al, as just "nothing".  In
    HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny, a Perl defined payload indicates a "Single" value,
    while the Perl undef value indicates the "nothing" value; this change
    should make dynamic generation of "Maybe" literals easier considering
    that Perl users tend to equate the Perl concept of undefined with the
    SQL concept of NULL, meaning nothing more than "not a normal value".

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, QRelation.pod,
    QSet.pod, Temporal.pod)  Updated any other files having references to
    "Nothing" so they reference "nothing" instead.

    * (Types.pod, Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, QRelation.pod, QTuple.pod)
    In Types.pod, deleted the data types "TupleD0" (singleton) and
    "RelationD0" (2 values) as they no longer seem useful; then updated the
    descriptions of the "Tuple" and "Relation" data types to give
    additional special names to the corresponding 3 values, "Tuple:d0" and
    "Relation:d0c[0|1]".  Updated any other files having references to the
    "D0" types so they reference the "d0" value names instead.

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny.pod)  Split up the "GENERAL STRUCTURE" main pod
    section into itself and the new "VALUE LITERALS AND SELECTORS"; then
    the latter was moved to be just above "OPAQUE VALUE LITERALS".  Also
    added the initially empty/todo new main pod section "DEPOT
    DECLARATION", just above "BOOTLOADER STATEMENT".

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny.pod)  Updated all the main pod sections
    ["GENERAL STRUCTURE", "BOOTLOADER", "LANGUAGE NAME", "VALUE LITERALS
    AND SELECTORS", "OPAQUE VALUE LITERALS", "COLLECTION VALUE SELECTORS"]
    and all their pod sub-sections, to strip out or summarize any Perl-Tiny
    description text that is redundant with the description text of the
    PTMD_Tiny dialect, since the former should now be able to piggyback on
    the latter; otherwise updated or rewrote or cleaned them up.

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny.pod)  Removed the now-unneeded brief main pod
    section REWRITE PROGRESS MARKER, in both files.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny.pod)  Other minor updates, fixes.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Updated this file to the latest grammar.

2009-04-29  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.66.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.66.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features major updates and additions to the PTMD_Tiny
    dialect, including fleshing out of descriptive text, such that this
    dialect's definition is now fully self-defined and you no longer have
    to look at the HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny dialects to fill in the gaps.
    That's not to say that the concrete grammars are complete (they're
    not), but now PTMD_Tiny is no longer lagging the other dialects with
    regard to completeness.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Basics.pod)  Renamed all of the
    "String" types from the generic "sys.std.Core.Type.\w+" namespace to
    the catalog-focused "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.\w+" namespace, and moved
    their definitions from Types.pod to Types_Catalog.pod; specifically the
    5 normal types "(|SE|B|O|UCP)String" plus the infinite number of
    "String.*" types were renamed.  The main reason for this change was to
    emphasize that the "String" types are not generally intended for direct
    use with user data, and should only be used mainly by other
    system-defined types and operators in their definitions.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod, QTuple.pod)  Renamed the 3 functions
    "sys.std.Core.Cat.Order_[[|conditional_]reverse|reduction]" to
    "sys.std.Core.Cat.Order.[[|conditional_]reverse|reduction]".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Split the pod section "VALUE LITERAL COMMON
    ELEMENTS" into the 2 sections "VALUE LITERALS AND SELECTORS" and "Value
    Literal Common Elements".  Renamed the illustrative grammar token
    "value" to "x_value", leaving just the one "value" that should actually
    be used in a generic grammar.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated every kind of quoted character string
    literals so that non-"space" whitespace characters may no longer appear
    literally, but must instead be denoted with escape sequences; to be
    specific, disallowed the 4 characters "\t\n\f\r" from appearing
    literally.  The main reason for this change was to ensure that the
    actual values being selected by char str literals were not variable per
    the kind of linebreaks used to format the Muldis D source code itself.
    These 3 grammar tokens were updated: "[text|comment|_payload]",
    "quoted_name_str".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added another simple escape sequence for quoted char
    str literals, "\s", representing a space (F;20).  Updated "Comment"
    literals so they can have optional leading or trailing space chars
    inside the # delimiters which are not part of the selected Comment
    value; you must escape leading/trailing spaces now if you want them
    included in the value.  These 2 grammar tokens were updated:
    "comment_payload", "escaped_char".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Renamed a few generic grammar tokens:
    "int_max_col_val" -> "num_max_col_val", "list_[open|close]" ->
    "nonord_list_[open|close]".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Refactored grammar tokens concerning generic
    relations, UTC temporals, etc.  Merged the "qrelation" token into the
    "value" token (and "payload"), then renamed the 2
    "generic_qrelation[|_payload]" to "qrelation[|_payload]", and renamed
    the 3 "generic_relation_\w+_payload" to "r_\w+_payload".  Split the 2
    tokens "utc_instant[|_payload]" into themselves and
    "float_instant[|_payload]", and updated the "value" and "payload"
    tokens accordingly.  Split the token "value" 3 ways into itself and
    "opaque_value_literal" plus "coll_value_selector".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the whole PTMD_Tiny grammar to add capturing
    parenthesis, so to help illustrate a map between the concrete grammar
    and anticipated parse tree nodes, which HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny are to a
    large degree.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Renamed all the grammar tokens that are either the
    main tokens or main payload tokens for value literals or selectors, so
    to spell the tokens the same way as their "value_kind" components which
    is the resulting type names; for example, the tokens that were named
    "rat_round_meth[|_payload]" are now named "RatRoundMeth[|_payload]".
    This also means that the grammar tokens and capture node names
    ("value_kind") now actually match each other.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Split up the following grammar tokens into
    themselves and additional parts, so to make them more self-documenting:
    "Blob_payload", "[[UTC|Float]Instant|UTCDuration]_payload",
    "String_payload", "r_ordered_qattr_payload".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the grammar tokens [Int, Rat, Blob,
    UTCInstant, FloatInstant, String, QTuple] and "value_kind" to add one
    or more "value_kind" alternative values which provide a terser
    alternative to common settings of a "value" node's "type_name"; for
    example, added "NNInt", "OctetBlob", "UTCDate", and "Database".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the top-level grammar so the language root
    token is "bootloader" and it composes a "language_name" token plus
    exactly one alternative between the 3 tokens "value", "depot", (a
    sequence of) "boot_stmt".  The "depot" one is new, and is declared in
    the new pod section "DEPOT DECLARATION".  Fleshed out the pod sections
    "BOOTLOADER", "VALUE LITERALS AND SELECTORS", "COLLECTION VALUE
    SELECTORS" with their own description paragraphs, and removed now
    redundant text from "GENERAL STRUCTURE".  Also small "DESCRIPTION"
    updates.  Also split the token "boot_stmt" into itself plus
    "generic_boot_stmt", the latter being the first of unspecified
    alternatives in the former, todo in a subsequent release.  The new
    "depot" token references 2 undeclared/todo tokens
    "depot_[catalog|data]".  Also updated the appropriate sub-tokens of
    "Q[Tuple|Relation|Set|Single|Array|Bag" so they now embed "expr" tokens
    rather than "value"; declaring the "expr" token is todo.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the "LANGUAGE NAME" main pod section plus
    all the pod sections specific to value node literals/selectors to add
    complete desc paragraphs to each one, all of these derived from their
    counterpart desc text in the HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny.pod files.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Removed the now-unneeded brief main pod section
    REWRITE PROGRESS MARKER.

2009-04-28  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.65.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.65.1.tar.gz.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny.pod)  Rearranged some POD
    sections:  Moved "BOOTLOADER" to just above "LANGUAGE NAME".  Moved
    "Nothing" to just above "Bool".  Moved "Order" and "RatRoundMeth" to
    just below "Bool".  Moved "Rat" to just below "Int".  Moved
    "[Instant|Duration]" to just below "Comment".  Moved
    "[UTCInstant|FloatInstant|UTCDuration]" to just below "Duration".
    Moved "String" to just below "UTCDuration".  Renamed "SIMPLE CORE
    SCALAR VALUE LITERALS" to "OPAQUE VALUE LITERALS", and "GENERIC
    Q/SCALAR AND Q/NONSCALAR VALUE LITERALS" to "COLLECTION VALUE
    SELECTORS", and removed the now-empty "TEMPORAL EXTENSION SCALAR VALUE
    LITERALS" heading.  Following these changes, "OPAQUE ..." has "Nothing"
    plus all the q/scalar selectors, including all the temporal selectors,
    but not "[|Q]Scalar", and "COLLECTION ..." has "[|Q]Scalar" plus all
    the q/nonscalar selectors, but not "Nothing".  The distinction between
    these 2 new groups is that "COLLECTION ..." has all the selectors which
    are visibly collections of other nodes, while "OPAQUE ..." has all the
    selectors which visibly have no component nodes; the latter are always
    constant expressions while the former might vary at runtime if child
    nodes are say function invocations or routine parameters.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny.pod)  Renamed all the level-2 /
    type-specific pod section headings from "sys.std.Core[.Cat]?.\w+" to
    headings that are more generic, in the process also merging a few
    similar such pod sections; 24 sections per file became 20.  The 3
    sections "[Name|NameChain|DeclNameChain]" merged into the 1 "DBMS
    Entity Name Literals", the 2 sections "[Instant|Duration]" merged into
    the 1 "TAI Temporal Literals", the 2 sections
    "[[UTC|Float]Instant|Duration]" merged into the 1 "UTC and Float
    Temporal Literals".  The simple renames were these 17 sections:
    "Nothing" -> "The Nothing Literal", "Bool" -> "Boolean Literals",
    "Order" -> "Order-Determination Literals", "RatRoundMeth" -> "Rational
    Rounding Method Literals", "[Int|Rat]" -> "General Purpose
    [Integer|Rational] Numeric Literals", "[Blob|Text]" -> "General Purpose
    [Binary|Character] String Literals", "Comment" -> "Code Comment
    Literals", "String" -> "Low Level Integer String Literals", "Tuple" ->
    "Tuple and Database Selectors",
    "[Q|][Scalar|Relation|Set|Single|Array|Bag]" ->
    "[Scalar|Relation|Set|Single|Array|Bag] Selectors",

    * (HDMD_Perl[6|5]_Tiny.pod)  Various other minor updates and fixes.

2009-04-22  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.65.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.65.0.tar.gz.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the possible simple escape sequences
    allowable in quoted character string literals.  The escape for
    backslash (F;5C), "\b", is unchanged.  The escape for
    apostrophe/single-quote (F;27) is now "\a" rather than "\q".  Added 2
    more escapes for visible characters, "\q" for double-quote (F;22) and
    "\h" for number-sign/hash (F;23).  Also added 4 more escapes for the
    most commonly written out invisible/control characters, that match
    their common meanings: "\t" for tab (F;9), "\n" for line-feed/newline
    (F;A), "\f" for form feed (F;C), "\r" for carriage return (F;D).  Note
    that, unlike with Perl/etc where the meaning of "\n"/etc may change
    depending on context, in Muldis D each escape always represents the
    same single Unicode codepoint.  The multi-part escape sequences
    "\c<...>" were unchanged.  As part of this update, the grammar token
    "quoted_char_str" was split into itself and "escaped_char".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Differentiated further the 3 main kinds of character
    string literals (Text/Blob, Name/chains, Comment) by giving each
    different delimiter characters.  Text and Blob retain their existing
    apostrophe/single-quote delimiters.  Name and chains based on it now
    have double-quote delimiters when they are quoted at all, and they can
    still be barewords where they could before; in practice there is little
    change here since most Name/chains tend to be barewords.  Comment now
    has numer-sign/hash delimiters, so it looks much like a Perl/etc
    comment except that a trailing # is also necessary; furthermore,
    segmented Comment literals now no longer use a tilde/~ between segments
    (Text/Name/etc still do), rather they just have optional whitespace
    between segments.  Regarding char escape sequences, within each kind of
    quoted character string literals, it is only mandatory to escape the
    same character as delimits that particular literal plus the backspace;
    using the other escapes is optional.  As part of this update, the
    grammar token "quoted_char_str" was removed and a customized version
    inlined into each payload/etc token that used to include it, and the
    tokens related to Name literal payloads were reorganized.  Also updated
    all relevant code examples to reflect the delimiter changes for
    Name/etc and Comment.

    * (D.pm, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  The previous change item also affected the
    format of PTMD_Tiny fully-qualified Muldis D language names; the
    authority and version number parts are now delimited with double-quotes
    as per Name, rather than single-quotes.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the support for unqualified value literals
    so "Comment" literals may now be written that way.  The only updated
    grammar token is "comment".

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Partially rewrote this file, mainly the
    syntax coloring regexes, to be cleaner and to reflect the previous
    PTMD_Tiny change items.  Also, Name/NameChain/DeclNameChain literals
    are no longer colored at all, since in general they should be treated
    consistently as identifiers.  Also, the "value kind" barewords,
    essentially all the unqualified main type names, are no longer colored
    as language keywords, as they should be treated consistently with
    either type or routine invocation names.

    * (BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist)  Made several additions corresponding to
    anticipated PTMD_Tiny grammar that is yet to be codified in the spec.
    Rewrote the routine scanning pattern to look for
    "[inner_]?[function|updater|procedure]" rather than "[name|'name'] \s*
    => \s* Name:".  Added a couple dozen new keywords to the syntax
    colorer, including both the routine makers and a bunch of possible
    infix operators that are actually sugar over normal prefix operators.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod, Ordered.pod,
    QTuple.pod, QSet.pod)  In Basics.pod, in the "Ordered Types"
    sub-section of "TYPE SYSTEM", updated the definition of an
    "order_determination" routine to give it a 4th, boolean parameter,
    "is_reverse_order", which is mandatory to define but optional to
    invoke.  It is now normal/expected that every order-determination
    function will fundamentally know how to operate both normally and in
    reverse, and support an ascending or descending value sort, with that
    ability being orthogonal to any other customizability it might have.
    In Types_Catalog.pod, updated the description of the "order" attribute
    of the "InnerScalarType" type to conform to the updated ord-det routine
    definition.  In Routines.pod, updated the "sys.std.Core.QScalar.order"
    function to add a "is_reverse_order" parameter.  In Ordered.pod,
    deleted function "sys.std.Ordered.reverse_order", which is no longer
    useful, and updated the description of the 2 functions
    "sys.std.Ordered.is_[|not_]before".  In QTuple.pod, updated the
    "sys.std.QTuple.order_by_attr_names" function to add a
    "is_reverse_order" parameter and otherwise update its description.  In
    QSet.pod, updated the description of the "sys.std.QSet.QMaybe.order"
    function.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  In Routines_Catalog.pod, added new function
    "sys.std.Core.Cat.Order_conditional_reverse", which should make the
    task of writing (bi-directional) generic "order_determination" routines
    easier, for those who want to write the least code to do the job.

    * (QRelation.pod, QArray.pod)  Updated each of the following 9
    functions to add a "is_reverse_order" parameter:
    "sys.std.QRelation.[rank|limit][|_by_attr_names]",
    "sys.std.QArray.[|limit_of_]QArray_from_wrap[|_by_attr_names]",
    "sys.std.QArray.QArray_from_attr".

    * (Integer.pod, Rational.pod, Temporal.pod)  Updated all 6 "sum" or
    "product" N-ary functions to rename each of their sole parameters to
    "topic" from "addends" or "factors" that they were before.  While
    strictly speaking the old names were more descriptive, the new names
    allow for better standardization in that all the other N-ary functions
    of Muldis D already named their sole/primary parameter "topic".

    * (Routines.pod)  Other minor fixes.

2009-04-16  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.64.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.64.0.tar.gz.

    * (Basics.pod)  Minor updates to "NOTES ON TERMINOLOGY", clarifying
    that a value literal is a common special case of a selector, and also
    that a constant may alternately be a niladic function.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the 8 relation
    types "ScaLitExprNodeSet" and
    "[ScaPR|Tup|Rel|[Func|Proc|Type|OrdDetFunc]Ref]LitExprNodeSet" to
    "ScaValExprNodeSet" and
    "[ScaPR|Tup|Rel|[Func|Proc|Type|OrdDetFunc]Ref]SelExprNodeSet"; the old
    names were actually inappropriate because partly the concept of a
    literal doesn't exist in a type definition (just in concrete code), and
    also child nodes of these nodes are often non-literal expressions such
    as function invocations.  Also renamed the corresponding 8 attributes
    of the database type "ExprNodeType", and updated the few other
    references to the renamed types to use the new names.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added 3 new relation types
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.[Set|Ary|Bag]SelExprNodeSet" which are like
    specialized versions of "RelSelExprNodeSet", with a simpler structure
    for the commonly used Set|Array|Bag value selectors.  Also added 3 new
    corresponding attributes to the "ExprNodeType" type.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Corrected an omission in the tuple type
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.InnerScalarType" by adding a new attribute
    "subtype_constraint", used when we are defining a proper subtype of
    another type, which constrains the base type's value set at least
    enough such that the new type's possrep maps can work without error,
    and it is possible for the new type's possreps' constraints to operate
    without error.  Also updated a few other cat type/attr descriptions.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, QTuple.pod, QRelation.pod, QArray.pod)  Added new
    order-determination function "sys.std.QTuple.order_by_attr_names" which
    provides a convenient short-hand for ordering tuples of a relation
    simply in terms of a list of attribute names; this saves users having
    to declare their own order-determination function for this common
    format of queries; also added new type
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.OrderByName" used by said new function.  Also
    added the 4 new wrapper functions
    "sys.std.QRelation.[rank|limit]_by_attr_names" and
    "sys.std.QArray.[|limit_of_]QArray_from_wrap_by_attr_names" which
    combine the previous function with their partial namesakes.  And so
    Muldis D now provides a direct analogy to the SQL syntax "ORDER BY foo,
    bar" etc that doesn't need a user-defined closure, though you still
    need the latter for the general case of "ORDER BY <expr>".

    * (Routines.pod)  Changed the "sys.std.Core.QRelation.summary" function
    by renaming its "result_attr_names" parameter to "summ_attr_names" and
    redefining its functionality more in terms of "extension" rather than
    "map"; the function given to "summ_func" must now just result in a
    tuple with attributes to add to a result which now already has all the
    attributes named by "group_per", rather than resulting in all
    attributes for the result.  The new version of "summary" should be much
    easier to use as presumably users always want to keep the attributes
    they are grouping per, and they now don't have to spell them out every
    time.  For the rare case where you want the old behaviour, now you have
    to do it manually with an explicit "cmpl_group" plus "map".

    * (Routines.pod, QBag.pod)  Added new function
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.cardinality_per_group" which is like "summary"
    but shorthands the common case where people just want a count of tuples
    per group and not any other information.  Also added new function
    "sys.std.QBag.QBag_from_cmpl_group" which is like the other new
    function but the result is a QBag.

    * (QBag.pod)  Added new function "sys.std.QBag.union_sum" which is like
    "sys.std.QBag.union" but that counts in the result come from summing
    the counts of the inputs rather than taking maximums of said.  Also
    updated the description of "sys.std.QBag.insertion" to clarify it is
    semantically like "union_sum" and not "sys.std.QBag.union" which is the
    direct analogy to set union.

    * Added new file "lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Counted.pod" which houses the new
    "Muldis D Counted Extension".  This extension defines special
    count-sensitive versions of all the common and applicable relational
    operators in Routines.pod and QRelation.pod, each new one taking an
    extra $count_attr_name argument that specifies which attribute of each
    normal argument contains the count and is to be treated specially, such
    that generally just the other attributes are considered in regards to
    the normal semantics of the operators, and the count attributes are
    summed or diffed as is appropriate.  Having these operators
    system-defined is probably the best way to support people who actually
    want bag-of-tuple semantics, or most precisely simulate the general
    case of bag-of-tuple behaviour of SQL for those using Muldis D as an
    intermediate representation, and then various users won't be
    reimplementing that wheel as multiple incompatible extensions.  This
    file has an initial complement of 22 new functions, all in the
    "sys.std.Counted.\w+" namespace: "[add|remove]_count_attr",
    "counted_[cardinality|is_[|not_]member|insertion|deletion]",
    "counted_[[|cmpl_]projection|[|maybe_]reduction|map]",
    "counted_is_[|not_][|proper_]subset",
    "counted_[union[|_sum]|intersection|difference]"
    "counted_[|static_]substitution".

    * (D.pm, Core.pod, README)  Added basic references to the new
    Counted.pod file.

    * (HDMD_Perl5_Tiny.pod)  Fixed a few detail fossils that became
    obsolete with last release's PTMD_Tiny changes.  Updated details for
    PHMD payloads of these 4 types: Bool, Int, Rat, Order.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl[5|6]_Tiny.pod)  Removed a fossil each that
    referenced the concept of a scalar without a possrep.

    * (Basics.pod, Routines.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Ordered.pod,
    QRelation.pod)  Minor updates.

2009-04-02  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.63.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.63.0.tar.gz.

    * Added new file "util/BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist" which is the first cut
    of a Codeless Language Module for the BBEdit text editor for Mac OS X
    that empowers BBEdit to syntax color and function scan code written in
    the PTMD_Tiny dialect of Muldis D.  Also added the support file
    "util/README" which explains the CLM further.  The new CLM is only as
    complete as the language spec itself, and mainly what it is the most
    complete about is syntax coloring Muldis D value literals.  Also
    updated the README file to refer to the "util/" and "archives/" dirs.
    While not exactly its intended use, you can get a taste of the CLM
    working by opening the PTMD_Tiny.pod file in BBEdit with the CLM
    installed and look at the various code examples in the POD file.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the "RatRoundRule" type to replace its
    "max_denom" attr (a "PInt") with a "min_exp" attr (an "Int").  This
    change was made so that rounding could be specified more easily and
    tersely; as well this change adds a feature in that rounding can now be
    specified to a multiple of a whole number greater than one, and not
    just to a multiple of a number of lesser or equal magnitude to one.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Made "Name" (and chains etc) value literals stricter
    in a couple ways.  First, segmented Name payloads must now have all of
    their segments quoted, not just those segments with characters outside
    of the nonquoted repertoire; a corollary to this is that if you have an
    otherwise nonquoted Name payload that is long enough to segment, you
    have to make it quoted to do that.  Second, nonquoted Name payloads
    must begin with a letter or underscore and may no longer start with a
    digit or hyphen; you must use the quoted form if you want to do that.
    These changes were made to aid code readability and reduce confusion of
    some Name literals with some Int literals.  In the process, a bit of
    grammar refactoring was done: "quoted_char_str_seg" was enlarged to
    include "segment_sep" and was renamed to "quoted_char_str", and now
    "[text|name|comment]_payload" refer to that; "nonquoted_char_str_seg"
    was renamed to "nonquoted_char_str".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Made "Bool" and "Order" value literals stricter such
    that they may only be specified with values allowed for their "name"
    possreps and no longer their "int" possreps.  So for example, you can
    say "Bool:false" or "false" but no longer "Bool:0".  Updated grammar
    tokens are "bool[|_payload]" and "order_payload".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the support for unqualified value literals
    so "Order" and "RatRoundMeth" literals may now be written that way.
    Updated grammar tokens are "order" and "rat_round_meth".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Made the grammar token "pint_tail" stricter so that
    two underscore separator characters may not appear in a row within any
    of the value literals defined in terms of numeric values.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Fixed a bug concerning all value literals defined in
    terms of numeric values where the int-max-col-val prefix is omitted;
    then the grammar should have allowed only the digits [0..9] are allowed
    in the numeric, rather than the [0..9A..F] allowed when the
    int-max-col-val is given.  This affects the 8 types: Int, String, Rat,
    Instant, Duration, [UTC|Float]Instant, UTCDuration, Bag.  In the
    process, added 7 grammar tokens each like the following 7 but for "d_"
    (decimal) prefixed to their name: "[|nn|p]int_body",
    "pint_[head|tail]", "[|nn]rat_body"; and updated the 8 grammar tokens:
    "[int|string|rat][[|utc_][instant|duration]]_payload", "count".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Fixed a bug concerning the "DeclNameChain" value
    literal format where the SCVL of that type with zero elements is simply
    the empty string, or the GCVL of the same has a trailing colon.  To fix
    this, updated the "decl_name_chain_payload" grammar token so that a
    zero-element DeclNameChain is represented by the special payload "[]";
    however, any DNC (or NC) with at least one element still have no "[]"
    delimiters surrounding the chain literal (unlike for "String" etc).

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl[5|6]_Tiny.pod)  For each dialect, added an
    example for each of the types "DeclNameChain" and "RatRoundMeth".

    * (D.pm, SeeAlso.pod)  Minor updates; changed notes about projects'
    owners from Darren Duncan to Muldis Data Systems.

2009-03-20  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.62.3 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.62.3.tar.gz.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Fixed a few search+replace errors that
    release 0.62.2 introduced.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Routines.pod, Types_Catalog.pod,
    Routines_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl[5|6]_Tiny.pod,
    Ordered.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod, Rational.pod,
    Temporal.pod)  General documentation reformat considering a frequently
    employed writing short-hand.  Often when text alternatives were
    displayed, and they had portions in common, the short-hand used fake
    Perl regex syntax; the main change was to update the short-hand to
    resemble Perl 6 syntax more and Perl 5 syntax less, mostly by
    substituting "[]" (non-capturing group) for "()".  This change was made
    partly so the new version is more readable considering "()" are used
    for other purposes in the same contexts while "[]" weren't.  It also
    brings greater consistency since Perl 6 rules are the standard format
    in other parts of the documentation for illustrating patterns.

2009-03-19  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.62.2 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.62.2.tar.gz.

    * (Routines.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, Ordered.pod, Integer.pod,
    Blob.pod, Text.pod, Rational.pod, QTuple.pod, QRelation.pod, QSet.pod,
    QArray.pod, QBag.pod, Temporal.pod)  Second draft at reformatting all
    system-defined routine signatures to match the planned new PTMD_Tiny
    format for declaring routines.  Where parameter declarations used to be
    formatted "p1(T1)" or "&p1(T1)" or "&p1(T1)?", they are now formatted
    "T1 $p1" or "T1 &$p1" or "T1 $p1?".  This change does not alter the
    verbosity one bit, but the code is arguably a lot prettier and easier
    to read or write.  So now PTMD_Tiny routine declarations now look
    almost identical in format to Perl 6 declarations, in fact at a glance
    one might confuse it for Perl 6.  Note for those of you accustomed to
    Perl 6 of these small differences: 1. all Muldis D params are named but
    don't have the ':' prefix like Perl 6; 2. the $ is not actually part of
    the parameter name, just syntactic sugar to help the grammar (there are
    no @%... sigils); 3. pass-by-ref params are marked with & not "is ref".

2009-03-19  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.62.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.62.1.tar.gz.

    * (Routines.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, Ordered.pod, Integer.pod,
    Blob.pod, Text.pod, Rational.pod, QTuple.pod, QRelation.pod, QSet.pod,
    QArray.pod, QBag.pod, Temporal.pod)  First draft at reformatting all
    system-defined routine signatures to match the planned new PTMD_Tiny
    format for declaring routines.  Where function declarations used to be
    formatted "function f result T0 params { p1(T1), p2(T2) }", they are
    now formatted "function f (T0 <-- p1(T1), p2(T2))", and where
    procedures/etc used to be formatted "procedure p update { p1(T1) } read
    { p2(T2) }", they are now formatted "procedure p (&p1(T1), p2(T2))".  A
    main benefit of this change is routine signatures should be
    considerably less verbose and easier to read and more like those of
    other languages, and also now subject-to-update parameters may now be
    mixed with read-only parameters, since the & prefix now is what
    indicates their being subject-to-update; similarly, routine invocations
    would use the & for subject-to-update arguments as well.

    * Muldis::D version 0.62.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.62.0.tar.gz.

    * Congratulations to the developers of Parrot (Speaks Your Language),
    which saw its long-awaited 1.0.0 release earlier today.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the "quoted_char_str_seg" grammar token to
    add support for specifying characters in terms of their Unicode
    codepoint name or number, in addition to the previous means of
    specifying characters as their literal selves in the presumably Unicode
    PTMD_Tiny source code.  The new feature is in the form of the escape
    pattern "\c<...>", where that any occurrences of such a substring in a
    quoted character string literal are replaced with the actual Unicode
    codepoint whose name or number is given by the "..."; the "..." takes a
    form like either "A..Z " for character names (example "\c<LATIN SMALL
    LETTER OU>") or "\d;\d+"|"\d+" for character numbers (examples
    "\c<F;263A>" or "\c<65>".  One reason for this feature is to empower
    specifying exactly which sequence of codepoints you want for a
    particular grapheme (which text editors tend to abstract away when you
    write characters literally), and also it is to empower more elegant
    passing of Unicode-savvy PTMD_Tiny source code through a communications
    channel that is more limited, such as to 7-bit ASCII.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl[5|6]_Tiny.pod)  Added "Text" value literal
    example to all 3 Tiny grammars illustrating how to specify characters
    in terms of Unicode codepoint names or numbers.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the "[|nn]rat_body" grammar tokens to be
    stricter such that rational-type numbers now may never look like
    integer-type numbers; specifically, where you used to be able to say
    "Rat:42" you must instead say "Rat:42.0".  This change affects not just
    "Rat" value literals but also "Instant", "Duration", and "UTC"/"Float"
    versions of the latter.  This change was made partly to aid code
    self-documentation and syntax highlighting, as well as support a
    subsequent change item (unqualified value literals).

    * (HDMD_Perl[5|6]_Tiny.pod)  Updates corresponding to previous change
    item, as was appropriate for each Perl version.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the "blob_payload" grammar token so that the
    string must be quoted rather than unquoted.  This change was made
    partly to aid syntax highlighting, especially with the empty string, as
    well as to support a subsequent change item (unqual value literals).

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Made "Text" and "Comment" value literals stricter
    such that all of their character string segments must be quoted; now
    only "Name"/etc character strings allow unquoted string segments.  In
    the process, did a bit of grammar refactoring that eliminated the
    "char_str[|_seg]" tokens and updated the "[text|name|comment]_payload"
    and "ln_base_[authority|version_number]" tokens.  This change was made
    to aid code readability as well as support a subsequent change item
    (unqualified value literals).

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl[5|6]_Tiny.pod)  Updated the Tiny dialects
    to add support for specifying generic context value literals of certain
    data types as just their payloads, without explicit "value kind"
    metadata; that is, added support for unqualified value literals.  Which
    data types this new feature is allowed to be used with varies by
    dialect.  With PTMD_Tiny, the 5 types [Bool, Int, Blob, Text, Rat] are
    supported.  With HDMD_Perl6_Tiny, the 8 types [Bool, Int, Blob, Text,
    Rat, Instant, Duration, Order] are supported.  With HDMD_Perl5_Tiny,
    the 3 types [Int, Text, Rat] are supported, albeit less rigorously.
    This change was made to aid code brevity and to make Muldis D
    significantly more like typical programming languages in regards to how
    one writes character string or numeric literals; in fact those formats
    are now exactly the same in general.  Most example code was updated to
    the new terse format, with typically just one example per type
    remaining in the old fully qualified format.  No grammar tokens were
    added, just some were changed.

    * (Routines.pod, Ordered.pod, Integer.pod)  Added the 6 new functions
    ["sys.std.Core.QRelation.[restriction_and_cmpl|semijoin_and_diff]",
    "sys.std.Ordered.[|maybe_]minmax",
    "sys.std.Integer.[|maybe_]quotient_and_remainder"]; each of these is
    just a wrapper over a pair of other mutually complementary functions.

    * (QRelation.pod)  Added new function
    "sys.std.QRelation.classification" which is sort of a cross between
    "restriction" and "group"; it uses a user-defined function argument to
    partition a q/relation's tuples into an arbitrary number of groups.

2009-03-13  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.61.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.61.0.tar.gz.

    * A Friday the 13th release.

    * (HDMD_Perl6_Tiny.pod)  Corrected the new Instant|Duration value
    literals to say that their payloads are simply Perl 6 Instant and
    Duration values, which are directly mapped, same as with value literals
    for [Bool, Int, Blob, Text, Rat, Name, Comment, Order] etc.  The
    previous descs saying to use Rat payloads only applied for Perl 5 Tiny.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod)  Updated the
    core type "Int" so it is no longer a primitive type but rather now is a
    structure type, which is defined in terms of a single-element "String"
    attribute; also added new core type "sys.std.Core.Type.SEString", a
    subtype of "String", for use in defining the updated "Int".  Also found
    any other references to the "Int" type that said it was primitive or
    had no possreps etc and updated them.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod)  Updated the
    core type "String" so it is no longer a primitive type but rather now
    is an enumeration type, which is implicitly defined in terms of a union
    over an infinite number of implicitly defined
    "sys.std.Core.Type.String.*"-named singleton structure types, each one
    being named with its value.  To support the infinite new implicit
    types, updated the "Name" type so its sole possrep's sole attribute is
    now "String" typed, rather than being "UCPString" typed like "Text".
    However, actual user exploitation of the new flexibility of "Name" is
    strongly discouraged, to the point that all of the standard Muldis D
    dialects remain unchanged and so "Name" value literals still only
    support what is supported for "Text", and one can only select one of
    the newer "Name" values by way of a "Scalar" value literal plus a
    "String" value literal.  Also found any other references to the
    "String" type that said it was primitive or had no possreps etc and
    updated them.

    * Following the last 2 change items, Muldis D has only 2 "primitive"
    types left, which are "QTuple" and "QRelation".  Moreover, Muldis D no
    longer has the concept of q/scalar root type with no possreps; all
    system-defined or otherwise q/scalar values now have 1/+ possreps.

    * (Routines.pod, QTuple.pod, QRelation.pod)  Updated all 15 functions
    and 5 updaters that had a "set_of.Name"-typed parameter named
    "[|\w+_]attrs" and renamed said parameter to "[|\w+_]attr_names"; any
    similarly named parameters that were of some other type, such as
    "QTuple", kept their old names.  This change should make the parameters
    more self-documenting, since "attrs" names now tend to have both
    attribute names and values, where as "attr_names" have just names.  The
    changed 20 routines were:
    "sys.std.Core.Q[Scalar|Tuple|Relation].[|cmpl_]projection",
    "sys.std.Core.Q[Tuple|Relation].assign_[|cmpl_]projection",
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.[summary|[|assign_]extension]",
    "sys.std.[Core.QScalar|Q[Tuple|Relation]].has_attrs",
    "sys.std.QRelation.[map|substitution|subst_in_[restr|semijoin]]".

    * (QRelation.pod)  Added new function "sys.std.QRelation.has_key".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, Temporal.pod)  Minor fixes.

2009-02-25  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.60.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.60.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types.pod)  Minor update to ambiguity-reduce the descriptions of 8
    types; replaced the text "its cardinality is" with the text "the
    cardinality of this type is"; the remaining types already used the
    newer wording.  Further related minor update with the 3 types [QMaybe,
    Nothing, QSingle] regarding text like "is a proper subtype of" that
    talks about the number of elements it has; this was updated to clarify
    it is talking about how many elements each member value of the type
    has, and it is not talking about how many member values the type has.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Rational.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod,
    HDMD_Perl(5|6)_Tiny.pod, Basics.pod, Core.pod, Temporal.pod, D.pm, the
    README file)  Promoted the 6 rational numeric concerning types [Rat,
    NNRat, PRat, PInt2_N, RatRound(Meth|Rule)] to the language core, where
    they how have a status like Blob and Text, which is being not necessary
    for bootstrapping a minimal Muldis D, but still being highly important
    for user data nonetheless; this said, in the near future, Rat may
    become needed by the system catalog if the latter starts storing
    time-stamps.  The 4 type declarations [Rat, NNRat, PRat, PInt2_N] were
    moved from Rational.pod to Types.pod, and their namespace changed from
    "sys.std.Rational.Type.\w+" to "sys.std.Core.Type.\w+"; the 2 type
    declarations [RatRound(Meth|Rule)] were moved from Rational.pod to
    Types_Catalog.pod, and their namespace changed similarly but for an
    extra ".Cat"; all 6 types were exactly the same after the move, except
    that the types' fully qualified names changed.  After these moves,
    Rational.pod has declarations for just the 3 types [BRat, DRat,
    PInt2_36]; all of its routines were kept, unchanged.  In each of the 3
    Tiny dialect files, the literal syntax for "Rat" and "RatRoundMeth" was
    moved upwards to go next to the appropriate other core scalar types,
    and the main documentation section "RATIONAL EXTENSION SCALAR VALUE
    LITERALS" no longer exists.  Any other files that referred to rational
    types or the rational extension were appropriately updated.

    * (Temporal.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl(5|6)_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the
    type "sys.std.Temporal.Type.Duration" to
    "sys.std.Temporal.Type.UTCDuration", in order to avoid a short-name
    conflict with an upcoming new type.  Also correspondingly renamed the
    "sys.std.Temporal.Duration.\w+" namespace.  For each of the Tiny
    dialects, also renamed the corresponding value literal node name from
    'Duration' to 'UTCDuration'.  In PTMD_Tiny.pod, renamed the 4 tokens
    "(instant|duration)(|_payload)" to prepend "utc_".

    * (Types.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl(5|6)_Tiny.pod)  Added the 2 new
    scalar types "sys.std.Core.Type.(Instant|Duration)" to the language
    core (Types.pod) and added corresponding special value literal syntax
    for them to all the Tiny dialects.  Unlike the existing types in
    Temporal.pod, which are focused more on calendar-based artifacts with
    distinct YMDHIS components and will DWIM with future dates, the new,
    disjoint types in Types.pod are simply counts of seconds in the TAI
    time scale, and are now the recommended types for tasks like timestamps
    or benchmarks or scientific applications.  The representation of each
    of these 2 new types is a rational numeric, and their Tiny literal
    syntax is exactly the same as for 'Rat' save for the different
    [Instant, Duration] value kind.  Within the language core, the 2 new
    types have the same status as 'Rat', which is being not necessary for
    bootstrapping a minimal Muldis D, but still being highly important for
    user data nonetheless; this said, in the near future, at least
    'Instant' may become needed by the system catalog if the latter starts
    storing time-stamps.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Added an initial complement of 7 new functions
    "sys.std.Temporal.Instant.((|abs_)difference|later|earlier)",
    "sys.std.Temporal.Duration.(abs|sum|difference)" and 1 new system
    service "sys.std.Temporal.Instant.fetch_current_instant" to go with the
    new core language "Instant" and "Duration" types as used in isolation
    from the additional types that Temporal.pod declares.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Added an initial complement of 2 new functions
    "sys.std.Temporal.UTCInstant.(UTC_from_TAI|TAI_from_UTC)", in the new
    main documentation section "FUNCTIONS FOR CONVERSION BETWEEN UTC AND
    TAI", which are for mapping "Instant" and "UTCDateTime" values.

    * (Basics.pod, Routines.pod, Rational.pod, Temporal.pod)  Minor updates
    and fixes.

2009-02-07  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.59.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.59.1.tar.gz.

    * (Routines.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, Ordered.pod, Integer.pod,
    Blob.pod, Text.pod, QTuple.pod, QRelation.pod, QSet.pod, QArray.pod,
    QBag.pod, Rational.pod, Temporal.pod)  Some POD reformatting:  Took
    what used to be some level-2 headings that grouped lists of routines
    and changed said into level-1 headings, but did not uppercase their
    text.  Then converted the routine lists from being "=over/=item
    <routine>/=back" to each routine having its own level-2 heading.  For
    each routine, the new heading is just the (fully-qualified) name of the
    routine, and the full signature of the routine displays just as its own
    paragraph.  All these changes combined should look visually like we are
    faking 3 levels of headings, with top and middle being upcased and
    mixed case "=head1" respectively.

    * (Spatial.pod)  Did similar to the previous change item but with the
    type list in Spatial.pod, so that is now formatted like all the other
    type lists in the spec, with a level-2 heading per type.

2009-02-07  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.59.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.59.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a set of smaller language enhancements that
    were inspired during development of the module Set::Relation version
    0.5.0 for Perl 5.  Set::Relation 0.5.0 also inspired plans for other
    language enhancements but those have been deferred to a future release.

    * (QRelation.pod)  Renamed the 10 "sys.std.QRelation."-namespace
    routines ["(|assign_)(|static_)substitution_in_(restriction|semijoin)",
    "outer_join_with_(|static_)extension"] to the much shorter
    abbreviations ["(|assign_)(|static_)subst_in_(restr|semijoin)",
    "outer_join_with_(|static_)exten"], so they are easier to type.

    * (QRelation.pod)  Updated each of the 3 functions
    "sys.std.QRelation.subst(|_in_(restr|semijoin))" to add the 1
    non-optional parameter "(|subst_)attrs", which lets the user spell out
    exactly which topic attrs are the ones that may be getting their values
    updated by the closure argument; while not strictly necessary, this
    extra constraint should force any use of each function to be more
    predictable and easier to implement.

    * (QTuple.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl(5|6)_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the 1
    function "sys.std.QTuple.substitution_in_default" to
    "sys.std.QTuple.subst_in_default".

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Routines.pod, QRelation.pod, QSet.pod)  A few
    minor description updates or fixes.

    * (README, D.pm)  Added mentions of Set::Relation in SUPPORT/FORUMS.

    * Updated all files with a "LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT" documentation
    section to change the Copyright declaration from "Darren Duncan" to
    "Muldis Data Systems, Inc." (which is wholly owned by Darren Duncan).

2009-01-19  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.58.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.58.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a set of smaller language enhancements that
    were inspired during development of the module Set::Relation version
    0.0.0 for Perl 5.  These 2 releases were made in tandem.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the grammar token "nc_elem_sep" to
    "name_chain_elem_sep" and refactored it to embed optional whitespace.

    * (Basics.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod)  A few minor fixes.

    * (Routines.pod, QRelation.pod)  Updated the 4 routines
    ["sys.std.Core.QRelation.((|assign_)extension|summary)",
    "sys.std.QRelation.map"] to add a "attrs" parameter; this is necessary
    in the general case where the "topic" parameter may have zero q/tuples,
    meaning the function that would otherwise define the added/result attrs
    wouldn't be invoked and said new attributes are not otherwise known.

    * (Routines.pod, QRelation.pod)  Added 1 routine
    "sys.std.Core.QTuple.static_extension" (dyadic version of "product"),
    renamed "sys.std.Core.QTuple.assign_product" to
    "assign_static_extension" (and its param "other" to "attrs"), and
    renamed "sys.std.QRelation.outer_join_with_product" to
    "outer_join_with_static_extension"; the new names are easier to
    understand, and the name "product" is saved for just N-adic operators.
    Also renamed the "sys.std.QRelation.composition" parameters from
    "r1|r2" to "topic|other".

    * (QRelation.pod)  Added the 2 new relational operators
    "is(|_not)_disjoint", which test if the intersection of their 2
    arguments is/is-not empty.

    * (QTuple.pod, QRelation.pod)  Added the 4 new relational operators
    "sys.std.Q(Tuple|Relation).is(|_not)_nullary", which complement the 2
    "is(|_not)_empty" operators; they test if the sole argument has zero
    attributes or not.

    * (Routines.pod, QRelation.pod)  A few minor description updates.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Updated the "CURRENT IMPLEMENTATIONS OF MULDIS D" main
    section to add 2 new items, which are the Set::Relation module for Perl
    5 and Perl 6 respectively.

2009-01-08  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.57.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.57.0.tar.gz.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Eliminated the "SysScaNPRTypeSet" type and the
    "System" type's "sca_npr_types" attribute; their role of declaring the
    2 types 'Int' and 'String' will now be handled by the "SysSpecTypeSet"
    type and "special_types" attribute.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Refactored the 2 pod sections "Procedures For
    Defining (Routines|Data Types)" into 2 alternate pod sections
    "Procedures For Defining (Depot|Package) Routines and Data Types";
    there were no changes to the 8 there-declared procedures themselves.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod)  Added new
    language concept of "topic namespaces", which is analogous to the
    frequently used SQL DBMS (or general purpose language) concept of a
    "current database|schema" (or current class etc).  In Basics.pod, added
    new primary namespace "tpc" ("topic"), and added new pod sub-section
    under "ENTITY NAMES" called "Time-Varying Topic Namespaces" which
    explains the new feature. In Types_Catalog.pod, added new data type
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.TopicNSControlCat" (for "tpc.cat") in new main
    pod section "TYPES FOR DEFINING TOPIC NAMESPACE CONTROLS".  In
    Routines_Catalog.pod, added new procedure
    "sys.std.Core.Cat.select_topic_namespaces" in new pod sub-section
    "Procedures For Defining Topic Namespaces"; also updated the previously
    existing 12 "create|drop" procedures for in-depot namespaces and
    routines and types so they no longer have explicit parent
    namespace-specifying parameters; instead, users must now set an
    appropriate topic namespace before invoking any of those "create|drop"
    routines, as the topic namespace now is the implicit topic namespace of
    the entity to create|drop.

    * (HDMD_Perl(6|5)_Tiny.pod)  Reorganized some pod sections, but did not
    make any language changes.  Merged the 2 pod main sections "CORE
    GENERIC NONSCALAR VALUES" and "QUASI- VALUES" into the 1 "GENERIC
    Q/SCALAR AND Q/NONSCALAR VALUE LITERALS", which also had the
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Scalar" sub-section moved to it; quasi and non-quasi
    variants of the same node kind are now described together.  Merged the
    2 pod main sections "CORE GENERIC SCALAR VALUES" and "CATALOG SCALAR
    VALUES" into the 1 "SIMPLE CORE SCALAR VALUE LITERALS".  Merged the 2
    "Instant" pod sub-sections into one.  Moved the 2 "BOOTLOADER" sections
    downward to just previous of the "PRAGMAS" section.  Renamed the 2
    "EXTENSION" main sections to replace "VALUES" with "VALUE LITERALS".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl(6|5)_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the concept
    "bootloader imperative routine call" to "bootloader statement"; the
    corresponding node kind was renamed from "boot_call" to "boot_stmt";
    the main pod section for it was likewise renamed.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added pod main section "MULDIS D TINY DIALECT
    PRAGMAS" which is simply a clone of the one in HDMD_Perl(6|5)_Tiny.pod;
    in any event, that whole section as we know it now is deprecated.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Refactored some grammar tokens, but did not make any
    language changes.  Split "language_name" into itself and
    "ln_base_name"; renamed "ln_authority" to "ln_base_authority", and
    "ln_version" to "ln_base_version_number".  Renamed "literal" to
    "value".  Renamed "val_(node|payload)_elem_sep" to
    "value_(node|payload)_elem_sep".  Renamed all "foo_or_qv" tokens to
    "qfoo".  Changed any "[Q]?" grammar fossils to "Q?".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Reorganized all the grammar tokens and code
    examples, but did not make any language changes.  The old 2 pod main
    sections "GRAMMAR OF TINY PLAIN TEXT MULDIS D" and "EXAMPLES" were
    replaced with 8 main sections having 22 sub-sections, of which 7 / 22
    correspond directly to those same-named in HDMD_Perl(6|5)_Tiny.pod (1
    "LANGUAGE NAME", 4 "VALUE LITERALS", 2 "BOOTLOADER); the 8th new main
    section was "VALUE LITERAL COMMON ELEMENTS".  Following this change,
    all Tiny.pod files now keep related grammar and code examples together.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Fleshed out the "VALUE LITERAL COMMON ELEMENTS" pod
    main section, so that it now supersedes the kind of information in the
    "GENERAL STRUCTURE" section of HDMD_Perl(6|5)_Tiny.pod; the latter will
    be stripped later.  Cloned and split the "value" token into itself plus
    the 2 new "value_kind" and "payload" tokens; there are now 2 versions
    of "value" in this section, showing things from different angles.  Also
    split the 3 tokens "(bool|order|rat_round_meth)" into themselves and 3
    additional "(bool|order|rat_round_meth)_payload".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added example code to the "BOOTLOADER" section which
    mimics the corresponding example code in HDMD_Perl(6|5)_Tiny.pod.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2009.

2008-12-27  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.56.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.56.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a snapshot of progress in rewriting the 3
    Muldis D dialect definitions so that, on completion of the rewrite, the
    Tiny Plain Text Muldis D dialect is now treated as the primary one,
    having the primary details and being self-sufficient, and the 2 Tiny
    Perl Hosted Data dialects are then delta documents of that one; prior
    to the rewrite, the reverse was true.  This rewrite is expected to be
    completed over the next 1-2 releases.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl(6|5)_Tiny.pod)  Rewrote most of the
    DESCRIPTION pod sections for each of the 3 files, and added a new
    GENERAL STRUCTURE main section to PTMD_Tiny.pod.  Also added a brief
    main pod section REWRITE PROGRESS MARKER to all 3 files to demark
    approximately the post-rewrite from pre-rewrite content.  There wasn't
    really anything removed or altered yet save the DESCRIPTION sections.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added TODO note in TYPE SYSTEM that a feature akin to
    Perl 6 roles, which could be used to provide a quasi-"specialization by
    extension" language feature, might be added in the future.

    * (Basics.pod)  Made various smaller edits to the TYPE SYSTEM main and
    sub-sections, for clarity or to further clean up the results of the
    quasi- made supertypes thing.  Updated the concept of 'scalar type' to
    say that not just a minimum of one but rather all of the possreps of a
    scalar may have only non-quasi attributes.  The concepts 'tuple type'
    and 'relation type' have been tightened to mean exactly what TTM says;
    all nonscalar types have fully-defined attribute lists; the ['Tuple',
    'Database', 'Relation', 'Array'] etc types are now actually
    quasi-nonscalar types even though all their values are non-quasi
    nonscalar.  The concept of 'remnant type' has been restricted to just
    mean a type drawing values from at least 2 of sca/tup/rel/ref; other
    prior uses of 'remnant type' such as for combinations of 'incompatible'
    tuple or relation values are now simply quasi-tuple or quasi-relation
    types instead; also removed the "Remnant Types" pod sub-section.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the TYPE SYSTEM main section to say that Muldis
    D now *does* enforce single MSTs for q/scalar types, just between those
    that declare possreps.  While Muldis D doesn't require this to absolve
    ambiguity in general, it simply seemed like a good idea, and targeted
    the main kind of circumstance that TTM cares about with its MST rule.

    * (Types.pod)  A couple small pod format fixes.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Routines.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Reduced any
    mentions of the concepts 'complete type' and 'incomplete|parameterized
    type'.  Also, now only quasi-nonscalar types can be incomplete, and
    also now just the sys-def types that don't list any attributes, like
    'Database', are called incomplete; by contrast, 'Array' and such are
    now called 'complete' (declaring all attrs, even if 'value' is
    'Universal').  Also updated the 'InnerScalarType' and 'InnerRestrType'
    type descriptions concerning what you can or can't use to define an
    incomplete type with.

    * (Routines.pod, QTuple.pod, QRelation.pod)  Added some basic value
    introspection functions which could be used in definitions of generic
    union or restriction types that aren't defined in terms of attribute
    lists, including the system-defined 'Relation' etc which are now
    defined in terms of 'QRelation' etc.  In Routines.pod, added the 5
    functions "sys.std.Core.QScalar.(has_possrep|possrep_names)" and
    "sys.std.Core.QScalar.(degree|has_attrs|attr_names)"; between
    QTuple.pod and QRelation.pod, added the 4 functions
    "sys.std.Q(Tuple|Relation).(has_attrs|attr_names)".

    * (Routines.pod)  Updated the 2 functions
    "sys.std.Core.QScalar.(|update_)attr" to make the 'name' parameter
    optional; like 'possrep', its argument defaults to the empty string if
    not given.  This seemed like a good idea since a lot of built-in
    scalar-with-possrep types have a single attribute per possrep with the
    empty name, and many simple user-def ones likely would also.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod)  Added new generic reference type "External"
    (a proper subtype of "Reference") to which belong any black-box values
    that result when a peer or host language, like Perl, wants to hand off
    any arbitrary value or object to Muldis D to hold onto for awhile, such
    as if Perl wants to organize arbitrary things in relations; those
    values are disjoint from all native-to-Muldis D values; these values
    are only transient and can't be kept in a database.

    * Muldis::D version 0.55.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.55.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features the first rough cut of a reorganization of the
    Muldis D type system such that the quasi-(scalar|tuple|relation) types
    are now proper supertypes of the scalar|tuple|relation types, rather
    than the 2 groups being disjoint yet very similar.  As part of this
    change, all of the generic scalar|tuple|relation operators have been
    made more liberal so to handle the quasi- supertypes natively; but
    their behaviour is unchanged when given arguments that were valid
    before, so these changes are essentially backwards compatible.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl6_Tiny.pod)  Fixed a few fossils.  In
    PTMD_Tiny.pod it was a grammar syntax error; in HDMD_Perl6_Tiny.pod it
    was an out-dated code example.

    * (Basics.pod, Routines.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Fixed one fossil per
    file regarding the declared type of 'assuming' parameters; each one
    said the parameter was a tuple but it has actually been a quasi-tuple
    for awhile now.

    * (Types.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Rational.pod, Temporal.pod)  Fixed
    all occurrences of the common documentation/grammar error in type
    definitions that said "a/an <foo-type> is a subtype of <bar-type>" by
    removing the leading "a/an"; the "a/an" designates a value, where we
    wanted to designate a type.

    * (QRelation.pod)  Added new updater "sys.std.QRelation.assign_empty"
    which is analogous to a SQL "TRUNCATE" statement.

    * (Types.pod, Basics.pod, Routines.pod, Types_Catalog.pod,
    PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl(5|6)_Tiny.pod, Ordered.pod, QSet.pod,
    QRelation.pod, QArray.pod, QBag.pod)  In Types.pod, renamed all 12
    Quasi- type declarations
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Quasi(Scalar|ScalarDVPT|Tuple(|D0)|Relation(|D0))"
    and "sys.std.Core.Type.Quasi(Set|Maybe|Nothing|Single|Array|Bag)",
    replacing the "Quasi" prefix with "Q".  In all 12 files,
    correspondingly updated all references to those types.

    * (Types.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl(5|6)_Tiny.pod)  Deleted the 4
    core types
    "sys.std.Core.Type.Q(ScalarDVPT|(Tuple|Relation)D0|Nothing)", and their
    corresponding special Tiny literal syntaxes.  Renamed the text-Tiny
    token "nothing_or_qv" to "nothing".  Updated the QScalar type
    declaration to not give a default value, giving it one is TODO next.

    * (Basics.pod)  Multiple updates to the TYPE SYSTEM main pod section.
    The 'Tuple' and 'Relation' types are no longer primitives but rather
    are now enumerations, of 'QTuple' and 'QRelation' values.  Under "Type
    Identification": Non-ref type system values are now all in 3 disjoint
    categories rather than 6, the 3 quasi- ones, with the 3 non-quasi now
    being subsets rather than disjoint.  Renamed the "Scalar Types" pod
    section to "Q/Scalar Types", the "Tuple Types and Relation Types" pod
    section to "Q/Tuple Types and Q/Relation Types", and the "Quasi- Types"
    pod section to "Distinction of Quasi- Types from Non-Quasi Types".

    * (Basics.pod)  Completely rewrote the previous-mentioned
    "Distinction..." section, so it now defines non-quasi types in concise
    terms of quasi- types plus a simple restriction ... the distinction is
    that with non-quasi types you can recursively ungroup/unwrap all
    attributes down to scalars, whereas with other quasi- types you can't.

    * (Types.pod)  Merged the 4 main documentation sections "SYSTEM-DEFINED
    CORE (|QUASI-)(|NON)SCALAR PARAMETERIZED DATA TYPES" into the 2 main
    documentation sections "SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE QUASI-/(|NON)SCALAR
    PARAMETERIZED DATA TYPES" and arranged all the type declarations such
    that each 2 similarly named (one quasi-, one not) types appear
    together, the parent quasi- type first.  Within each pair, the quasi-
    parent type now contains most of the descriptive details the pair has
    in common, and the non-quasi one now specifies it is a proper subtype.
    Also reorganized the TYPE SUMMARY documentation section to reflect the
    new type hierarchy.  Also updated the QScalar type declaration to say
    its default value is now the same as Scalar and Bool.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the TYPE SUMMARY pod section to add the
    3 nodes Q(Scalar|Tuple|Relation) to the tree between Universal and
    Scalar|Tuple|Relation.  Also updated the description of the
    'special_types' attribute of the 'System' catalog type to remove
    'Scalar|Tuple|Relation' from the list, leaving just 11 items; said 3
    types will instead be declared under the 'types' attribute of 'System',
    as they now have a type definition format like what users can declare.
    Also updated any mentions, in various catalog entity descriptions, of
    tuple|scalar|relation values or types to add the prefix "q/" where
    either those or their more general quasi- types are applicable.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated these 6 catalog types to remove each
    type's "is_quasi" boolean/maybe-of-bool attribute: "SysScaNPRTypeSet",
    "(ScaPR|Tup|Rel)LitExprNodeSet", "Inner(S|Nons)calarType".  In the case
    of "SysScaNPRTypeSet", there are no longer any system-defined
    no-possrep types that aren't scalar.  As for the rest, whether they are
    non-quasi or not will be determined by looking at each type's
    attributes' type definitions, essentially the same work as is done with
    union etc types.

    * (Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Rational.pod, Temporal.pod, Spatial.pod)  In
    these, the 5 language extension files that declare data types, updated
    each file's TYPE SUMMARY pod section to add the single QScalar node to
    the tree between Universal and Scalar; in just Rational.pod, also added
    the single QTuple node between Universal and Tuple.

    * (Routines.pod, Ordered.pod, QTuple.pod, QRelation.pod, QSet.pod,
    QBag.pod, QArray.pod)  Updated all the generic relational operators and
    other generic scalar or nonscalar operators to gain savvy with the
    wider quasi- versions of the types they handled before.  These still
    have the same semantics as before with non-quasi values that worked
    before.  Generally speaking, any declared result or parameter types of
    "Scalar|Tuple|Relation|Set|Maybe|Single|Array|Bag" have now been
    changed to "QScalar" etc; also, all declared result or parameter types
    of "ScaTupRel" have been changed to "Universal".  (So the "ScaTupRel"
    type is no longer used in any system-defined entity signatures, but it
    continues to be declared for the convenience of user-defined entities.)
    Also any "(set|maybe|single|array|bag)_of" type prefixes attached to a
    now-Q-type result or parameter type declaration have been changed to
    "quasi_\w+_of" versions.

    * (Routines.pod, QTuple.pod, QSet.pod, QArray.pod, QBag.pod,
    QRelation.pod) Related to the previous changes, to make their names
    more accurate, 15 routines were renamed to
    ["sys.std.Core.QScalar.(QTuple_from_QScalar|QScalar_from_QTuple)",
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.(QTuple_from_QRelation|QRelation_from_QTuple)",
    "sys.std.QTuple.(attr_from_QTuple|QTuple_from_attr)",
    "sys.std.QSet.QSet_from_(wrap|attr)",
    "sys.std.QArray.(QArray_from_(wrap|attr)|limit_of_QArray_from_wrap)",
    "sys.std.QBag.(QSet_from_QBag|QBag_from_(QSet|wrap|attr))"] from the
    same names but lacking any "Q".

    * (Routines.pod)  Updated the descriptions of the 2 routines
    "sys.std.Core.QRelation.un(wrap|group)" to specify that they would fail
    with certain quasi-relation arguments due to their TVAs or RVAs not
    having consistent attribute sets (a problem that non-quasi relations
    never have, by definition).

    * (Routines.pod, QSet.pod, QArray.pod)  Updated the descriptions of the
    8 routines
    ["sys.std.Core.QRelation.(is_(member|subset)|difference|join)",
    "sys.std.QSet.is_member",
    "sys.std.QArray.(update_value|insertion|is_element)"] so that they now
    warn rather than die on type incompatabilities of input relations that
    would make the routine result in a general quasi-relation rather than a
    relation.  Note that there might be other routines needing similar
    documentation updates, but the above 8 were the only ones easily
    locatable by their use of the word "incompatible".  In fact, most
    routines were simply silent on the matter, the behaviour being implied.

    * (Core.pod, Routines_Catalog.pod, Conventions.pod)  Minor entity
    description updates re quasi-/non merge.

2008-12-16  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.54.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.54.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features the first rough cut of a split in the Perl
    Hosted Data Muldis D dialect into separate versions for Perl 6 and Perl
    5 where each is optimized for its mutually very distinct host, making
    heavy use of features from one version that aren't in the other.  Or
    technically, the split was largely done in release 0.53.0, where
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod gained disjoint descriptions between Perl 6 and Perl
    5 hosts for almost everything; this current release mainly just
    separates those into distinct files.

    * (HDMD_Perl6_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl5_Tiny.pod, D.pm, Basics.pod,
    Types.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, README)  Cloned the 1 file HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    once and renamed the original and copy into HDMD_Perl(6|5)_Tiny.pod
    respectively.  Updated each copy so it excludes the details not
    relevant to its now single host language, and further tweaks the
    remaining more generic text to become more specialized.  Updated all
    other distro files that referred to the old 1 file so they refer to the
    new 2 instead.

    * This release also has the first step of rearranging the Muldis D type
    hierarchy to make the quasi- types into proper supertypes of their
    non-quasi namesakes, rather than disjoint but similar types.  The
    primary change now is renaming some files, but otherwise leaving
    related changes minimal; the main changes will be done in the next
    release, so that it would be easy to diff the important changes without
    having to deal with the complexity of simultaneous file name changes.

    * (QTuple.pod, QRelation.pod, QSet.pod, QArray.pod, QBag.pod, D.pm,
    Core.pod, README)  Renamed the 5 files [Tuple.pod, Relation.pod,
    Set.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod] to add a 'Q' prefix.  Updated all other
    distro files that referred to the old file names so they refer to the
    new ones instead.

    * (Routines.pod, QTuple.pod, QRelation.pod, QSet.pod, QArray.pod,
    QBag.pod, Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, HDMD_Perl(6|5)_Tiny.pod,
    Ordered.pod)  Renamed all "sys.std.Core.(Scalar|Tuple|Relation).\w+"
    entities to "sys.std.Core.Q(Scalar|Tuple|Relation).\w+", and all
    "sys.std.(Tuple|Relation|Set(|.Maybe)|Array|Bag).\w+" entities to
    "sys.std.Q(Tuple|Relation|Set(|.QMaybe)|Array|Bag).\w+".

2008-12-15  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.53.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.53.0.tar.gz.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod,
    Routines_Catalog.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, Conventions.pod, Ordered.pod,
    Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod, Rational.pod)
    Updated all distro files that referred to catalog types using their
    unqualified name so to remove the 'Cat.' prefix; now the unqualified
    references for all system-defined types are just spelled 'Foo' and the
    catalog types are no longer special case spelled 'Cat.Foo'.

    * (Types.pod, Blob.pod)  In Types.pod, added new proper subtype of
    'Blob' named 'OctetBlob' whose string lengths are a multiple of 8 bits,
    and that subtype added a new possrep 'octets'.  This new subtype is for
    convenience of users since most user Blob values will likely consist of
    whole octets and users would probably like to deal in those terms.
    Also added new 'String' subtype 'OString' in the same file.  In
    Blob.pod, renamed the 2 functions "is_(|not_)_substr" to
    "is_(|not_)_substr_bits" and added the 3 new functions
    "length_in_octets" and "is_(|not_)_substr_octets".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Fixed a widespread Perl 6
    grammar mistake in PTMD_Tiny.pod; with character classes defined as a
    range between 2 characters, the endpoints of the range are actually
    separated by a double period (which is generic Perl range literal
    syntax), not a single hyphen like in Perl 5.  Likewise updated the
    string format syntax in HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the concept "node type" to "node kind",
    to help avoid possible confusion with the concept of a data type name.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the 4 grammar tokens "text_str",
    "(|(|non)quoted_)text_str_seg" to replace any "text" for "char, since
    they're also used for Name and Comment etc.  Renamed the token
    "list_sep" to "list_elem_sep" and "pair_sep" to "pair_elem_sep".  The
    token "scalar_type_name" was merged into "type_name".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the NameChain and DeclNameChain types to
    eliminate their "flat" possreps, leaving just their "array" possreps;
    the concept of a "flat" possrep has been demoted and can now just be
    provided by individual dialects in their proprietary manners instead.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated both Tiny dialects to
    simplify the literal formats for NameChain and DeclNameChain values.
    With PTMD_Tiny, you can't put a whole (multi-part) chain in a single
    pair of bracket or quote delimiters anymore; instead, each kind of
    chain is just expressed as a non-delimited chain of period-separated
    Name-formatted elements; only each element can be either a bareword or
    a quote-delimited string; now, literal period characters in chain
    elements are never escaped; now, DeclNameChain are formatted exactly
    the same as NameChain, without any leading/trailing periods.  With
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny, eliminated all Muldis D specific character escaping;
    now, if you want to have literal perod characters in chain elements,
    then you must use the Array payload format; also an empty string in the
    string payload format now means a single-element DeclNameChain; you
    must use the Array payload format to represent a zero-element chain.
    In PTMD_Tiny, merged the 5 grammar tokens "(|d)nc_(array|flat)" and
    "nc_char" into the 2 "(|decl_)name_chain_body" and then merged the 2
    grammar tokens "text_(delim|char)" into the 1 "quoted_char_str_seg".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Further standardized the formats
    and generic features of Muldis D value literals in both Tiny formats so
    that literals are more intuitive to write and easier to parse or
    generate.  Now, every value literal has 1-3 main parts, which are the
    node kind, a usually optional type name, and a usually mandatory
    payload.  Previously, most scalar typed literals didn't take an
    (optional) explicit subtype name like nonscalar typed literals did, but
    now they do.  Any old 1+ main literal parts besides the node kind and
    optional type name are now all collectively part of the payload under
    the new design.  In PTMD_Tiny, the 'spec_sep' token has been split into
    the 2 tokens 'val_(node|payload)_elem_sep', the first new one being a
    colon character like the old one, and the second new one being a
    semicolon character; the first new one is used to separate the 1-3 main
    parts of a value literal, and the second is used to separate any
    multiplicity of payload parts that some payloads might have.  In
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny, the main documentation has been refactored so that the
    GENERAL STRUCTURE pod section now describes the 1-3 main PHMD node
    parts on behalf of all node kinds, and the pod sections specific to
    each node kind have now been simplified to just describe the new
    payloads; where the old PHMD node had just 1 element besides node kind
    and optional type name, the new payload is exactly the same; where the
    old PHMD node had possibly multiple (typically 1 or 2) elements besides
    the node kind and type name, the new payload is an Array|Seq having
    those same 1 or 2 elements (the old 'payload' was renamed, typically to
    'main payload'); any further refactoring on this matter is described in
    other change items.  The main PHMD node is an Array|Seq in the general
    case but if a node would have 2 elements (no type name is present),
    then in Perl 6 there is now the option to use a Perl 6 Pair for the
    PHMD node instead.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated PTMD_Tiny to support an
    alternative more terse syntax for base-10 numeric literals; you can now
    write a numeric literal without an explicit max-col-val specifier,
    which is interpreted the same as an explicit max-col-val of '9'
    (HDMD_Perl_Tiny already supported this terse form before).  Both Tiny
    files had their examples updated to use the terse syntax for literals
    that were explicitly base-10 before.  Also added a couple more 'Rat'
    examples in PTMD_Tiny.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Refactored all the tokens denoting value literals so
    that the payload portion is always apart from the main portion, and
    further standardized naming for already existing such splits.
    Reorganized the 4 tokens ["relation_or_qv",
    "generic_relation_(empty_body|(|non)ordered_attr)_or_qv"] into the 6
    tokens ["(|generic_)relation_or_qv",
    "generic_relation_(|empty_body|(|non)ordered_attr)_or_qv_payload"].
    Renamed the 2 tokens "(tuple|bag)_body" to "(tuple|bag)_or_qv_payload".
    Split each of these 12 tokens into itself and a same-named but for a
    "_payload" suffix: "scalar_or_qv", "int", "string", "blob", "text",
    "set_or_qv", "single_or_qv", "array_or_qv", "comment", "rat",
    "instant", "duration".  Renamed each of these 2 tokens to change the
    "body" to "payload": "name_body", "name_chain_body".

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Forked every "Examples:" section into 2
    adjacent "Perl 6|5 Examples:" sections, with each version having
    identical-meaning code but with greater savvy for distinct host
    language features.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated the value literal payload formats for
    the 3 types [Bool, Order, RatRoundMeth] so that the Perl 6 and Perl 5
    descriptions are now disjoint.  Perl 6 has been restricted so that now
    the only way you can specify 'Bool' and 'Order' payloads is with their
    Perl 6 native counterparts, which are 'Bool' and 'Order' objects; you
    can no longer specify such payloads as Perl 6 Int or Str objects; so a
    PTMD_Tiny parser in Perl 6 will now have to do more than tokenize to
    Str objects.  In Perl 5 you still have all the options you did before,
    and these are now spelled out more clearly; you can still use all the
    canonical or typical Perl 5 forms of those values, plus the string
    results of a PTMD_Tiny parser in Perl 5.  Since 'RatRoundMeth' has no
    native equivalent types in either Perl version, you still use Str
    objects or char string scalars as before.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated the value literal payload formats for
    the 7 types [Int, String, Blob, Rat, (UTC|Float)Instant, Duration] so
    that the Perl 6 and Perl 5 descriptions are now disjoint.  Perl 6 has
    been restricted so that now the only way you can specify 'Int' and
    'Blob' and 'Rat' payloads is with their Perl 6 native counterparts,
    which are 'Int' and 'Blob' and 'Rat|Num|Int' objects; you can no longer
    specify such literals as Perl 6 Str objects, or specify Rat payloads as
    a collection of Int components; for all 7 types, you can no longer use
    'Str' objects plus max-col-val metadata to get the Muldis D
    implementation convert the results from a PTMD_Tiny tokenizer, but
    rather you must now use the native facilities of Perl 6 to support
    denoting numeric literals in any base from 2 thru 36; Perl 6 can do the
    text-to-num mapping for you, and Perl 6's native numbers are "big".  In
    Perl 5 you still have all the options you did before, and these are now
    spelled out more clearly; you can still use all the canonical or
    typical Perl 5 forms of those values, plus the string results of a
    PTMD_Tiny parser in Perl 5.  One large further change in Perl 5 is that
    you now use a 1-element hash ref to group a max-col-val (the key) with
    the main payload it is metadata for (the value); this is instead of
    using a 2-element array ref; this change was made so that one could
    disambiguate 'Rat' payloads like "['2', '11001001']" (is the first
    element a max-col-val or a numerator?) without using messy further
    array nesting; it was done with all max-col-val possibly using types
    for consistency and to allow further simplification and elegance.  Note
    that it is expected the actual use of max-col-val would be infrequent,
    so huffman coding with the 'slower'/'fatter' hash refs is justified.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated the value literal payload formats for
    the 5 types [Text, (|Quasi)Tuple, (|Quasi)Array] so that the Perl 6 and
    Perl 5 descriptions are now disjoint.  There aren't any actual changes
    or restrictions here, just clarifications.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated the value literal payload formats for
    the 4 types [(|Quasi)Set, (|Quasi)Bag] so that the Perl 6 and Perl 5
    descriptions are now disjoint.  Perl 6 has been restricted so that now
    the only way you can specify 'Set' and 'Bag' payloads is with their
    Perl 6 native counterparts, which are 'Set|KeySet' and
    'Bag|KeyBag|Set|KeySet' objects; you can no longer specify such
    literals as single or nested Perl 6 Seq|Array objects.  In Perl 5 you
    still have the same options you did before (namely single or nested
    array refs), and these are now spelled out more clearly.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated the value literal payload formats for
    the 2 types "(|Quasi)Scalar" so that the Perl 6 and Perl 5 descriptions
    are now disjoint.  In Perl 6, the 2 elements of the payload (possrep
    name and possrep attrs) are now wrapped up in a Perl 6 Pair rather than
    a Seq|Array.  In Perl 5, a 2 element array ref is still used.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated the value literal payload formats for
    the 2 types "(|Quasi)Relation" so that the Perl 6 and Perl 5
    descriptions are now disjoint.  In Perl 6, every payload now must be
    either a Perl 6 Pair (ordered attrs format) or Set (named attrs
    format), and can't be a Seq|Array like before; also, the value element
    of that Pair must likewise be a Set; so now every part of the literal
    that was conceptually unordered now actually is.  In Perl 5, array refs
    are still used like before.

    * Muldis::D version 0.52.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.52.0.tar.gz.

    * As of this release, all (non-archive) versioned files have had their
    version numbers increased to match the version number of the release
    itself, or in other words, to match the version number of D.pm; from
    now on, all file versions will increment in lockstep regardless of
    whether any actual (other) changes were made to the files in question.
    This means that the meaning of the file version numbers has changed
    from treating each file as a distinct document whose progress is
    tracked, to being a component of the Muldis D language spec as a whole,
    such that if any file is seen in isolation, it can more easily be
    matched up with other files that form parts of the same Muldis D
    language spec version.  This also makes further updates to the spec
    easier since managing many distinct version numbers was a lot more work
    and error-prone; examples of such errors were that the previous 2
    releases (50 and 51) both forgot to increment their changed .pod files'
    internal versions like the Changes file of those releases said they
    were.  To see what actual changes were made to files, the individual
    change items still will list them as they did before.

    * (D.pm, Basics.pod, Types.pod, Routines.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod,
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod, Tuple.pod,
    Relation.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod, Rational.pod, Temporal.pod)  Updated
    all the standard references to numbers that are zero or greater so they
    are referred to as "non-negative" rather than "unsigned".  Renamed the
    2 generic data types "U(Int|Rat)" to "NN(Int|Rat)" and the 3
    Temporal.pod specialty data types "UInt(23|59)" and "URatLT62" to
    "NNInt(23|59)" and "NNRatLT62".  A few plain-text Tiny grammar tokens
    were likewise renamed, from a "u" prefix to a "nn" prefix.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Minor misc fixes.

2008-11-29  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.51.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.51.0.tar.gz.

    * This release serves mainly to add a new conceptually lower level
    abstraction layer to the Muldis D type system such that the (unlimited
    size) integer is now the only primitive scalar type, and all other
    types are now explicitly defined just in terms of integers, directly or
    indirectly.  This release's changes are fully backwards compatible,
    only adding features; the 2 exceptions being that certain subtleties of
    character strings have changed, and a bit about reference types.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.51.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.36.0 and
    Routines.pod and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.32.0 and Basics.pod and Rational.pod
    0.30.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.29.0 and Integer.pod and Blob.pod
    0.28.0 and Types.pod and Text.pod 0.27.0 and Temporal.pod 0.10.0.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Text.pod)  Updated the definition of
    character strings and the 'Text' data type (and indirectly, 'Name',
    'Comment', etc) to explicitly say that Muldis D works at the Unicode
    codepoint abstraction level, not the grapheme abstraction level, so
    what codepoints comprise a grapheme are significant for value identity.
    This change was made to make Muldis D simpler to define in isolation
    and more future-proofed and deterministic etc, and easier to extend
    such as for locale-specific things, versus the undefined 'highest
    possible' abstraction level it previously had.  In Text.pod, added new
    function 'length_in_codepoints' to complement the existing
    'length_in_graphemes', and changed the exact meaning of the latter;
    also added the 2 new functions 'folded_to_NF(C|D)' (to be generified
    later), which you would use if you want to effectively work at the
    grapheme abstraction level.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Added new union type
    'sys.std.Core.Type.Reference' that is disjoint from all the
    non-'Remnant' types, and updated the 4 'Func|Proc|Type|OrdDetFunc)Ref'
    types so they are now in this new category and are no longer in the
    quasi-scalar category (which now has no system-defined non-DVPT types).

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)
    Redefined the Bool core type so that rather than having zero possreps,
    it now has 2: 'name' (a Name) with values ['false', 'true']; 'int' (an
    Int) with values [0, 1].  Also updated the plain-text Tiny dialect so
    that '0' and '1' are now acceptable Bool literals along with 'false'
    and 'true' (no change was needed in HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod as it already
    supported 0|1).  So Bool is now defined structurally and syntax-wise in
    the same way as Order.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Redefined the QuasiScalarDVPT core
    type so that rather than having zero possreps, it now has 1, with zero
    attributes.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod,
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added new core scalar type
    'sys.std.Core.Type.String', which has zero possreps; a String is
    defined as a dense sequence of 0..N (unlimited size) integers,
    similarly to the primitive string types of many programming languages;
    unlike Array, String is *not* defined over a Relation and its elements
    can only be integers.  Updated the 2 Tiny dialects so they gain special
    literal syntax for String values.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod)  Added new core subtype
    'BString' (bit string) of String where each element must be between
    zero and 1, and redefined the Blob core type so that rather than having
    zero possreps, it now has 1, and Blob is now simply a wrapper over
    BString having a different intended interpretation.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod)  Added new core subtype
    'UCPString' (Unicode codepoint string) of String where each element
    must be between zero and 0x10FFFF, and redefined the 3 core types
    Text|Name|Comment so that rather than having zero possreps, each now
    has 1, and each of Text|Name|Comment is now simply a wrapper over
    UCPString having a different intended interpretation.

    * (Basics.pod)  Made some large additions and changes to the TYPE
    SYSTEM main documentation section of Basics.pod, primarily to declare a
    new parallel type categorization system, wherein every Muldis D type is
    just one of these 4 kinds, depending on how the type is defined:
    primitive type, structure type, enumeration type, reference type.  Also
    the definition of a root type (and nonroot type) has been restated in
    terms of these categories, which should be a lot more understandable.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Rational.pod,
    Temporal.pod)  Annotated all the Muldis D data type definitions, either
    individually or by documentation section, to say which of the above 4
    categories each one belongs to.

    * Muldis::D version 0.50.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.50.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.50.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.31.0 and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.28.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (D.pm)  In the VERSIONING section, clarified that a Muldis D language
    name can have some elements optional in documentation, in which case
    the partial name refers to the whole subtree of language variants
    having the specified elements in common.  Also simplified the
    Extensions sub-section to say that whether a 5th or subsequent elements
    exists and their format varies by the dialect in use.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Simplified all value literals having an
    'any_perl' format hint option, namely
    Bool|Int|Rat|(UTC|Float)Instant|Duration, by removing said option.  So
    now the most liberal Perl-specific format options are gone; however,
    the more strict Perl-specific formats (that disallow whitespace for
    example) that remain now allow a few more options than before.  A
    perl-bool in Perl 5 may now use either the number zero or the empty
    string to mean false, not just the empty string.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Simplified all value literals having a format
    hint portion, namely
    Bool|Int|Blob|Order|Rat|(UTC|Float)Instant|Duration, by removing said
    format hint portion.  With the numeric, blob, and temporal value
    literals, the test for how to interpret the payload is based simply on
    the number of node elements, which is 3 for md and 2 for perl, and the
    old 3rd/4th format element was redundant now that any-perl no longer
    exists.  With bool and order types, that are both very short enums, we
    can unambiguously determine what bool/order value was wanted by
    examining the Perl data type and Perl values of the payload.  Overall,
    this change should eliminate another kind of tedious verbosity that was
    common to Perl-Tiny code.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  In a reversal of one aspect of
    release 0.20.0, updated most nonscalar value literal syntax to re-add
    the then-removed explicit metadata of what specific data type the
    nonscalar value is a member of, rather than it for example being a
    generic relation value.  But use of this metadata is now optional
    rather than mandatory like in its previous incarnation.  Also removed
    the 'treat_as_type' lexical pragma, which is now redundant.

2008-10-07  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.49.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.49.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.49.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.30.0 and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.27.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  In PTMD_Tiny.pod, updated
    numeric-based literals to permit use of the underscore character as a
    separator, which may make long numbers easier to read (eg
    Int:1_000_000_000); in HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, made the same change
    concerning 'md_\w+' formats of numeric-based literals.  Note that
    concerning 'perl_\w+' formats, Perl already has this support built-in.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  In a reversal of one aspect of
    release 0.20.0, there is no longer special terse
    syntax for 'Name' literals appearing in the position of a generic
    literal; the general syntax for 'Name' literals / PHMD nodes is now
    exactly the same as for 'Text' or 'Comment', such as "Name:'foo'" and
    "[ 'Name', 'foo' ]" rather than plain "'foo'".  On the other hand,
    'Name' literals appearing in special positions where one is already
    expected, such as nonscalar literal attribute names, are retaining the
    terse syntax there.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Simplified 'Bag' literals by removing their
    format hint portion.  Because 'Name' literals no longer have the
    special Perl Str syntax in generic literal contexts, we can now
    unambiguously interpret a 'Bag' literal payload without an external
    format hint.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Simplified the entire grammar by removing all
    capturing parens, and the 'grammar' declaration, that a real grammar
    would have, so the given syntax can be a more clear human illustration.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Fixed a widespread Perl 6 grammar mistake;
    non-capturing groups are actually delimited by square brackets, not
    round parenthesis like in Perl 5.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  In PTMD_Tiny.pod, updated the
    grammar for all comma-separated lists so that there now must not be a
    trailing comma after the last list item; previously, a trailing comma
    was mandatory.  Note that there is no corresponding HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    change since trailing commas are always optional in Perl.  Updated all
    PTMD_Tiny.pod code samples to conform to the updated grammar, and
    updated just some HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod code samples likewise.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Refactored grammar for numeric literals, adding the
    2 new tokens 'pint_(head|tail)'.  Also updated numeric literals so that
    they may now be split into segments as per character or bit strings,
    with the '~' segment separator character; useful for very long numbers.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added support for bareword / non-delimited character
    string literals, mainly intended to be used for 'Name' (and NameChain
    etc) literals but also useable for Text and Comment literals.  A
    character string may be used non-delimited iff it is non-empty and only
    consists of the characters [a-zA-Z0-9_-], but allowable bareword
    characters may be expanded later to include anything Unicode considers
    a letter or a number.  Since most DBMS entity names and attribute names
    etc are likely to qualify for bareword syntax, this change helps make
    Muldis D code be easier to write and more like normal languages.  Also,
    the 'PTMD_Tiny' 4th element of its fully qualified language name is now
    always a bareword rather than always a delimited string.

2008-09-18  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.48.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.48.0.tar.gz.

    * Fixed the version numbers inside the 2 files PTMD_Tiny.pod and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod; they should have been 0.28.0 and 0.25.0
    respectively in Muldis-D-0.47.0 but were mistakenly not incremented
    like the Changes file of that release said they were.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.48.0 and Routines.pod 0.31.0 and
    PTMD_Tiny.pod and Rational.pod 0.29.0 and Integer.pod and Set.pod
    0.27.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.26.0 and Temporal.pod 0.9.0.  The other
    pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * Updated the README file to indicate that a new public repository at
    http://github.com/muldis/ is planned for the near future.

    * Updated the Makefile.PL to remove the obsolete warning message about
    a warning message that the POD manifyer might give.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Simplified 'Bag' literals by
    removing their format hint portion when the payload portion would be
    unambiguous without the hint.  In PTMD_Tiny.pod, no hints are necessary
    at all, so removed the ':count' and ':repeat' syntax entirely; then
    refactored the 3 'bag_\w+' tokens into 4 'bag_\w+' tokens.  In
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, the 'bag' PHMD node type can now have either 2 or 3
    elements; it must now have 2 when the payload is a Perl 6 Bag|KeyBag,
    and it must still have 3 when the payload is an Array|Seq; so the
    'perl_bag' hint is gone, but the 'aoa_counted' and 'array_repeated'
    hints remain (because there is ambiguity between the latter 2 in the
    general case when we have no hint, due to a 'name' node being a Str).

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Simplified 'Rat' literals by
    removing or folding their format hint portion.  In PTMD_Tiny.pod, no
    hints are necessary at all, so removed the ':radix' and ':ratio' and
    ':float' syntax entirely; then refactored the 4
    'rat(|_with_radix|_as_(ratio|float))' tokens into 2 'rat(|_body)'
    tokens.  In HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, the format hints were folded from 10 to
    3 as follows: 3 'md_(radix|ratio|float)' became 1 'md_rat', 4
    'perl_(rat|float|int_(ratio|float))' became 1 'perl_rat', 3
    'any_perl(|_(ratio|float))' became 1 'any_perl'; also, the reference to
    a Perl 6 "Float" type (which it doesn't have) was corrected to "Num".

    * (Routines.pod)  Removed the 2 niladic functions
    "sys.std.Core.Bool.(false|true)", which are superfluous given that all
    Muldis D dialects would have a dedicated syntax for Boolean literals,
    which are scalars having no possreps.

    * (Set.pod)  Added new order-determination function
    "sys.std.Set.Maybe.order" which provides a short-hand to defining
    semantics analogous to SQL's "NULLS FIRST|LAST".

    * (Integer.pod, Rational.pod)  Added 2 dyadic functions
    "sys.std.(Integer|Rational).abs_difference", each of which results in
    the absolute difference between its 2 arguments.

    * (Temporal.pod)  As anticipated would be necessary following the
    previous rewrite in release 0.34.0, rewrote the Muldis D Temporal
    Extension again; the most serious issues cited after the previous
    rewrite are now gone.  The temporal data types, and associated
    operators, are now few and generic rather than many and specialized, so
    the combinatorial explosion is gone; the number of distinct types
    dropped from 28 to 14, and routines from 93 to 17.  The 2 previous
    distinct units 'second(|s)' (int), 'fractional_second(|s)' (rat) have
    been merged into the 1 distinct unit 'second(|s)' (rat).  A year zero
    is now supported where it previously wasn't.  The concepts of multiple
    time zones and daylight savings time adjustments are now gone; instead,
    date-time types now just come in 2 kinds, those known to be specific to
    UTC, and those that are floating and not tied to any zone; if you want
    to work with time zones or DST, you must now explicitly convert to/from
    UTC on input and output.  The DESCRIPTION pod received some updates but
    is mostly the same as before.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Rewrote the complement of temporal data types.  In
    summary, the previous 21 temporal scalar root types were replaced by 3
    new temporal scalar root types plus 6 new scalar subtypes.  Each new
    root type declares 1 possrep and each new subtype adds 1 more possrep.
    Each new root type possrep consists of 6 maybes of numerics, so the
    root types can represent arbitrary precision as before, but also
    represent that information on larger units is unknown while in smaller
    units it is known; each subtype says that exactly certain parent
    attributes are known and others are unknown (eg, just YMD or HIS are
    known).  For specifics: 6 '(Date|Time)To(I|S|FS)WithTZ' became 4
    'UTC(Instant|DateTime|Date|Time)', 9
    '(DateTo(Y|M|D|I|S|FS)|TimeTo(I|S|FS))' became 4
    'Float(Instant|DateTime|Date|Time)', 6 'DurationOf(Y|M|D|I|S|FS)'
    became 1 'Duration' (this last one may gain a few subtypes in the
    future).  Regarding the plain numeric subtypes declared by Temporal,
    the 1 'NZInt' was removed and the 2 ['UInt62', 'URatLT1'] were replaced
    by the 1 'URatLT62'; the 4 ['PInt(12|31)', 'UInt(23|59)'] remained
    unchanged.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Rewrote the complement of temporal math functions and
    system services.  In summary, the previous 63 temporal math functions
    and 30 system services were replaced by the new 11 temporal math
    functions and 6 system services.  For specifics: 18
    '(Date|Time)To(I|S|FS)WithTZ.(difference|later|earlier)' became 4
    'UTCInstant.((|abs_)difference|later|earlier)', 27
    '(DateTo(Y|M|D|I|S|FS)|TimeTo(I|S|FS)).(difference|later|earlier)'
    became 4 'FloatInstant.((|abs_)difference|later|earlier)', 18
    'DurationOf(Y|M|D|I|S|FS).(abs|sum|difference)' became 3
    'Duration.(abs|sum|difference)', 6
    'DateTo(I|S|FS)WithTZ.fetch_current_date_(utc|local)' and 6
    'TimeTo(I|S|FS)WithTZ.fetch_current_time_(utc|local)' became 3
    'UTCInstant.fetch_current_(datetime|date|time)', 12
    'DateTo(Y|M|D|I|S|FS).fetch_current_date_(utc|local)' and 6
    'TimeTo(I|S|FS).fetch_current_time_(utc|local)' became 3
    'FloatInstant.fetch_current_(datetime|date|time)'.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added special syntax for value
    literals of temporal data types, defined in terms of 3 new keywords or
    PHMD node types: 'UTCInstant', 'FloatInstant', 'Duration'; each of
    these is built from an ordered list of up to 6 elements, which are
    numbers (YMDHIS).  Also added 6 new example literals using the new
    keywords/node-types.  Also added an example generic Scalar literal
    showing how to write a temporal value in terms of named/unordered
    components.  Also updated the example of a Single literal to contain
    some other piece of text that isn't a date string.

2008-08-30  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.47.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.47.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.47.0 and Routines.pod 0.30.1 and
    PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.28.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.25.0.  The other
    pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the pragma
    "auto_complete" of both Tiny dialects to "auto_add_attrs".

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added new pragma to both Tiny
    dialects named "auto_unabbrev_std_names", which when turned on lets a
    programmer omit leading chain elements of "Cat.NameChain" literals
    referencing "sys.std"-named types and routines, so long as the
    abbreviated version is unique within that namespace (with an exception
    iff exactly 1 candidate is "sys.std.Core"-named).  So this now makes
    official a kind of optional brevity that was often done with parameter
    data types in routine documentation, though not yet elsewhere, that can
    cut names of types or routines down to a half or sixth of the length
    they would otherwise have.  Almost all of the pod additions were in
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, as a new sub-section of the "MULDIS D TINY DIALECT
    PRAGMAS" pod at the end; like that file's pod in general, it speaks for
    both Tiny dialects.  The only change in PTMD_Tiny.pod was addition of a
    code sample of a Muldis D language name declaration that turned the
    pragma on.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added new pragma to both Tiny
    dialects named "auto_chains_from_names", dependent on the previous 2
    pragmas being turned on, which when turned on lets a programmer write
    an abbreviated-to-a-single-chain-element "Cat.NameChain" literal as a
    terser "Cat.Name" literal.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Fixed typos.

    * (Routines.pod)  Removed the placeholder main pod section
    "SYSTEM-DEFINED GENERIC QUASI- FUNCTIONS"; at such point that any
    routines for quasi- types are formally defined, they will just go in
    language extensions rather than the language core.

2008-08-17  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.46.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.46.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.46.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.35.0 and
    Routines.pod 0.30.0 and Basics.pod 0.29.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.27.0 and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.24.0 and Routines_Catalog.pod 0.2.0.  The other
    pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Bootloader routines
    may now directly reference global variables, and can now invoke any
    kind of imperative routine that has subject-to-update parameters,
    including updaters.  In Basics.pod, updated the 'bootloader' routine
    kind description and made related updates in the ROUTINES main pod
    section.  With both Tiny.pod, updated the grammar and examples for
    boot_call tokens/nodes so they now have distinct subject-to-update and
    read-only arguments.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Removed the partly defined "Cat.DbVar" type,
    which is no longer being used.  Updated the "Cat.(Depot|Package)" types
    to change their "data" attribute to have the "Cat.NameChain" type
    rather than "Cat.DbVar"; now, that attribute just holds the declared
    name of the data type of the dbvar of the depot|package, where the type
    is declared first as its own DBMS entity, or otherwise the declared
    type is simply "Database".  Similarly updated the type of the "catalog"
    attribute of the "Cat.SysCatSet" type to a NameChain from a DbVar.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  It is now optional for a
    depot|subdepot|package to have a self-local dbvar, which should help
    save us from some chicken and egg constraints that come into play when
    one wants to do data definition of depots etc.  In Basics.pod, the
    "User Namespace Correspondence" pod sub-section of "ENTITY NAMES" got
    some large updates.  In Types_Catalog.pod, the data type of the "data"
    attribute of the "Cat.(Depot|Package)" types is now a
    "maybe_of.Cat.NameChain" rather than a "single_of.Cat.NameChain".

    * (Routines.pod)  Added a set of 9 new update operators where each is a
    short-cut over a tuple|relational function plus a generic assignment of
    the function's result to the main relvar argument of the function; a
    subset of these correspond directly to the data-manipulation phase of
    common SQL "CREATE|ALTER|DROP TABLE|VIEW" statements.  These 4 updaters
    were added as "sys.std.Core.Tuple.\w+":
    "assign_(rename|product|(|cmpl_)projection)".  These 5 updaters were
    added as "sys.std.Core.Relation.\w+":
    "assign_(rename|(|static_)extension|(|cmpl_)projection)".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the "Cat.Federation" type by adding a
    third attribute "type_maps", which indicates the various copies of the
    same type over multiple depots, such that the DBMS can then treat those
    types as interchangeable, so to support cross-depot operations.  Also
    added the 2 new catalog types "Cat.FedTypeMap(Set|)" which define that
    new attribute.

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Grouped all the procedures under a new main
    pod section "PROCEDURES FOR BOOTSTRAPPING A MULDIS D PROGRAM OR
    DATABASE", where their old groupings became second-level pod sections.
    Wrote an introduction to this section that outlines what the procedures
    do or don't do, and explains them in the context of what a bootloader
    can directly do and what it can only do indirectly by defining and
    executing other routines.  Removed part of the "DESCRIPTION" as now
    being redundant or outdated.

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added new/first lexical-scope
    pragma to both Tiny dialects named "treat_as_type", which takes the
    form of a wrapper syntax/PHMD-node that annotates the
    typically-nonscalar child lexical/node with a specific data type.  Used
    alone, this can help with some kinds of compile-time type checking.
    Used together with the "auto_complete" language-name-level pragma, this
    can help determine what names and types of attributes need to be
    auto-added to literals that are otherwise "just a relation|tuple" and
    lack that specific metadata, such as with argument values for
    bootloader-invoked routines that have "Relation" typed parameters.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Fixed typos.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added a few TODO-ish comments in ENTITY NAMES
    sub-sections that any references to
    "sys.cat.(system|impl|mount|foreign|interp)" are out-dated; the actual
    system catalog doesn't mention them, and the catalog also still has to
    be updated to have a place for describing implementation specific
    entities; currently "(sys|mnt).cat" describe just standard entities;
    the out-dated parts are being kept as a reminder of ideas still todo.

    * Muldis::D version 0.45.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.45.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.45.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.34.0 and
    Basics.pod and Rational.pod 0.28.0 and Types.pod and PTMD_Tiny.pod
    0.26.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.23.0 and Routines_Catalog.pod 0.1.0.
    The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (D.pm)  In the "VERSIONING" pod section, updated the description of
    the 5th "Extensions" name part to clarify that name+value entries in it
    could also be pragmas or compiler directives.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the "Terse Pseudo-Variable Syntax" sub-section
    of the main pod section "ENTITY NAMES", so it now says that one can
    also use that terse syntax to drill down into attributes of relations,
    but that the situations where this can be used are more limited than
    for tuples or scalar possreps, such as that you can just use it to
    refer to the same attribute of all relation tuples at once, such as in
    some constraint definitions.  (Also noted there that, for now, other
    parts of the Muldis D spec may ignore this new fact.)

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Muldis D now officially has the concept of a
    relation having exactly one (or none) primary key, which is privileged
    over other unique keys it might have.  A primary key permits a tuple to
    have an identity other than the sum-total of all its attributes' values
    (being instead just the sum-total of its primary key attributes), so
    that it is now possible to conceive that a tuple in a relation may be
    "updated", rather than just be replaced with a different tuple.  This
    change should simplify some implementation details, such as
    auto-mapping of split relvars, and it should also make transition
    constraints easier to define, as often such are based on the concept of
    a relvar tuple being updated.  Mostly this change involved rewriting
    the description of the "is_primary" attribute of the "Cat.KeySet" type;
    but the "Cat.DistribKeySet" and "Cat.InnerNonscalarType" types were
    also affected.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the various system-defined
    relation types, or relation-typed attributes of other types, that were
    indicated to have (unique) keys on them, so that some (in fact, most)
    of those explicit keys are now explicitly privileged as primary keys
    instead.  For the general purpose types, just "Array" and "Bag" had
    this update.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added a "is_base" attribute to the
    "Cat.PossrepSet" type, which is an optimization hint for less
    intelligent Muldis D implementations as to how they choose a physical
    representation for a scalar type.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Rational.pod)  Updated the documentation for all
    4 of the system-defined multiple-possrep scalar root types to indicate
    that each has an implementation hint for choosing a physical
    representation; the types in question are: "Cat.(|Decl)NameChain"
    ("flat"), "Cat.Order" ("int"), "Rat" ("float").

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Added new function
    "sys.std.Core.Cat.Order_reduction" which provides the canonical terse
    way to chain multiple order determination function calls into a larger
    such function, typically as the controller for when you want to sort a
    relation's tuples, as per a generic SQL "ORDER BY".

    * (HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added new/first pragma to both
    Tiny dialects named "auto_complete", which when turned on lets a
    programmer omit specifying some attributes of literals, and those
    missing ones will be automatically supplied by the parser with default
    values from the relevant types.  So this now makes official a kind of
    optional brevity that was often done in example code that tended to cut
    the size of Tiny code in half from what it otherwise would have been.
    Almost all of the pod additions were in HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, as a new
    main section "MULDIS D TINY DIALECT PRAGMAS" at the end; like that
    file's pod in general, it speaks for both Tiny dialects.  The only
    change in PTMD_Tiny.pod was addition of a code sample of a Muldis D
    language name declaration that turned the pragma on.

2008-08-12  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.44.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.44.0.tar.gz.

    * Rounded out the Core.pod file tree by adding the new file
    lib/Muldis/D/Core/Routines_Catalog.pod, which debuts at version 0.0.0;
    this new file is where the core Muldis D data definition routines would
    be defined.  The appropriate references were added in other files
    [Core.pod, the README file].

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.44.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.33.1 and
    Routines.pod 0.29.0 and Relation.pod 0.27.0 and Text.pod 0.26.0 and
    Core.pod 0.21.3.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Routines.pod)  Fixed the "upd_invo" routine so that its "upd_args"
    parameter is non-optional, because all updaters have at least 1
    subject-to-update parameter.

    * (Text.pod)  Muldis D now just has a single function for testing the
    length of a Text value, which is "length_in_graphemes"; this replaces
    the previous 4 functions "length_in_nf(c|d)_(graphs|codes)".

    * (Routines.pod, Relation.pod)  Added a set of 18 new update operators
    where each is a short-cut over a relational function plus a generic
    assignment of the function's result to the main relvar argument of the
    function; a subset of these correspond directly to the common SQL
    "INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE" statements.  In Routines.pod, these 11 updaters
    were added as "sys.std.Core.Relation.\w+":
    "assign_(|disjoint_)(insertion|union)",
    "assign_(deletion|(|cmpl_)restriction)",
    "assign_(intersection|(|semi)difference|semijoin)".  In Relation.pod,
    these 7 updaters were added as "sys.std.Relation.\w+":
    "assign_exclusion",
    "assign_(|static_)substitution(|_in_(restriction|semijoin))".

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  In a reversal of one aspect of release
    0.19.0, brought back the then-removed "Cat.Order_reverse" function,
    under the slightly updated name "sys.std.Core.Cat.Order_reverse".

    * (Routines_Catalog.pod)  Added an initial complement of 22 data
    definition procedures, each of which is an abstraction for inserting or
    deleting a tuple in a catalog relvar.  These 22 procedures were added
    as "sys.std.Core.Cat.\w+":
    "(create|drop)_(depot_mount|subdepot|package)",
    "(create|drop)_(depot|package)_(function|updater|procedure|type)".  In
    addition, the 1 procedure "alter_depot_mount_so_we_may_not_update" was
    added in that namespace, which instead updates a catalog tuple.

    * (Routines.pod)  Added an initial complement of 7 generic standard I/O
    system service routines, which should now round out provisioning Muldis
    D to be computationally complete.  The 7 system service routines were
    added as "sys.std.Core.STDIO.\w+": "(read|write|error)_Text(|_line)",
    "prompt_Text_line".  These are mainly for implementing command-line
    user interfaces and error diagnostics for programs, and just handle
    Text; there are no bit string equivalents as yet.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Fixed a few typos.

2008-07-29  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.43.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.43.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.43.0.  The other pre-existing versioned
    files are unchanged.

    * Savagely chopped the Live Talk version of the Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807
    slideshow to remove all the content text, keeping just the section
    headings, a handful of bullets, and all but one of the code samples.
    There should be no doubt whatsoever now that the presenter isn't
    reading the slides; also, this result is more like the actual Takahashi
    format that the XUL software is designed for; also, it now should be
    easier to fit into the allowed time.  This was presented at OSCON on
    July 23.  Then the Stand Alone version had its end updated to format
    like the rest of the SA slideshow.  And so following this, this
    2-version 2008 July slideshow is now frozen into the archives.

    * The file archives/OSCON2008SessionProposal.txt was moved from the
    Muldis Rosetta version control / distribution to the Muldis D one; also
    there is now just one copy versus with 2 versions of Muldis Rosetta.

2008-07-21  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.42.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.42.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.42.0.  The other pre-existing versioned
    files are unchanged.

    * Edited and trimmed the slideshow "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807.xul"
    substantially, removing about 30% of its size.  The changes were
    inspired largely by feedback from several sources on the version in
    release 0.41.0.  The cuts mainly were about removing "boring" parts
    like introductives and less interesting or common features; also many
    parts were edited to say the same thing in substantially fewer words;
    all in all, this was just fat trimming and the result shouldn't lack
    anything useful that was in the previous one.  This new version would
    barely fit in 45 minutes if read aloud, but it is in fact now intended
    as the paper for download, so people not at a live talk based on this
    can still get all the material.  There was also some reordering, and a
    bit of additions near the front to make it easier to know early what
    the talk and the project is about.

    * Forked said slideshow into a "_sa" (Stand Alone) and "_lt" (Live
    Talk) version, the former being the version for viewing on its own, or
    use as speaker's notes, and the latter for actual display during the
    talk.  The live version changes the quasi-sentences of the stand alone
    to bullet points and less text.  This was presented at PDXPug PGDay on
    July 20th.

    * Partly due to feedback gotten at the OSCON speakers' workshop on July
    21, the talk will be redone again, using a different presentation tool,
    and making the live version have very little content so it differs
    greatly from what is spoken, this all in preparation for July 23.

2008-07-15  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.41.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.41.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.41.0 and Basics.pod 0.27.1 and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.22.1.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Fixed typos.

    * Rewrote the slideshow "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807.xul" so it has
    more appropriate content, and is a better length.  While this version
    should be complete on talking about Muldis D, it still lacks anything
    on Muldis Rosetta, which should end up about 10% of the size, except
    that there are internal todo notes on this.  And next I'll need to chop
    down the size of the new version so it can be presented in about 45
    minutes, for which I'll solicit advice.  That cut version should be in
    a near future subsequent release.

2008-07-08  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.40.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.40.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.40.0.  The other pre-existing versioned
    files are unchanged.

    * Added new file "archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807.xul" which is the very
    rough first draft of the slideshow for the 2008 July talk "Muldis D -
    Portable Databases At Full Power".  This talk is created for giving at
    OSCON 2008, and it is also being given at several other events in 2008
    July.  Following a practice presentation on 2008 July 8th, which used
    the (first half of) this exact file (except new postscript first
    screen), it was decided to completely rewrite the slideshow with
    different content.  Meanwhile this version is now being released on
    CPAN for posterity.  The next CPAN release of Muldis D will not have
    this version, rather its replacement.  This talk is a XUL file and it
    requires Mozilla Firefox to run (or you can read its text in a text
    editor).  Also added the 2 support files "archives/takahashi.(css|js)"
    plus the file "archives/README".

2008-07-04  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.39.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.39.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.39.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.33.0 and
    Routines.pod and Array.pod 0.28.0 and Basics.pod 0.27.0 and Ordered.pod
    and Relation.pod and Set.pod 0.26.0 and Tuple.pod and Bag.pod 0.25.0.
    The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the catalog type 'DKMemRelAttrMap' so
    its 'rel_name' attribute is now a 'DeclNameChain' rather than a 'Name'.
    So now, relation-typed attributes participating in a common distributed
    (unique) key no longer have to be direct siblings, but rather could be,
    eg, cousins instead; that is, now members of a distributed key may be
    spread out in different namespaces (within a common depot).

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Added new routine kind
    "virtual_attr_map" in the ROUTINES main section, so to formalize the
    concept of a mapping function used to define virtual nonscalar
    attributes in terms of a functional dependency on other attributes, in
    general not 1:1.  Added new catalog type 'VirtualAttrMapSet' which
    embeds such a function and defines virtual attributes of a nonscalar
    type which it is embedded into; also added 'NameDNCMap' which supports
    the first addition.  Updated the 'InnerNonscalarType' catalog type to
    add a new 'virtual_attr_maps' attribute.  Features provided by this
    update include virtual relvars (views), and the easier ability to do
    things like case-insensitive key constraints.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added 3 new catalog types ['ForeignKeySet',
    'ForeignDistribKeySet', 'FKChildAttrParentAttrMap'], and added 2 new
    attributes 'foreign_(|distrib_)keys' to the 'InnerNonscalarType' type.
    These additions provide canonical abstraction syntax for
    foreign/referential key constraints between relation-valued attributes
    or their attributes etc of a nonscalar type; two versions exist, one
    that targets a key of a single relation as the parent, and one that
    targets a distributed key on multiple relations as the parent.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added 4 new quasi-scalar catalog types
    '(Func|Proc|Type|OrdDetFunc)Ref' as an initial solution to the problem
    that plain 'NameChain' don't actually work too well as values to
    represent closures or higher order functions in the general case,
    particularly when wanting to use an inner routine as a closure to pass
    to another routine defined in some external context; these were added
    in the new main pod section "TYPES FOR SPECIAL ENTITY REFERENCES".
    Also added 4 new expression node catalog types,
    '(Func|Proc|Type|OrdDetFunc)RefLitExprNodeSet', for selecting values of
    the first 4 types.  Also added 5 new attributes to the 'ExprNodeSet'
    type that are of the 4 new node types.

    * (Routines.pod, Ordered.pod, Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod,
    Array.pod, Bag.pod)  Updated all routine parameters that conceptually
    were closure-et-al-typed (each such parameter took the name of a
    function or imperative routine or data type), so that their actual
    types were the new '(Func|Proc|Type|OrdDetFunc)Ref' types rather than
    the 'NameChain' type.  Also updated all routine parameters that take a
    set of argument values for closures so that the data type of said
    parameters is 'QuasiTuple' rather than 'Tuple', which is more
    appropriate in the general case.

2008-06-30  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.38.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.38.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.38.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.32.0.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Split up the catalog type 'ProcStmt' 3 ways into
    the catalog types ['StmtNodeSet', 'CompoundStmtNodeSet',
    'ProcInvoStmtNodeSet']; also updated the 'InnerProcBody' type to rename
    its 'stmts' attribute to 'stmt' and retype that attribute from
    'array_of.ProcStmt' to 'StmtNodeSet'.  So now the main body of a
    procedure has been restructured to be more like the main body of a
    function, such that the procedure body is now a tree of statement nodes
    rather than a flat sequence of statements; now each tree node is a code
    block grouping its child nodes.  This restructuring has resulted in 2
    initial kinds of statement nodes; a compound statement node is a
    sequence of other statements; a procedure invocation node invokes a
    named procedural routine.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added new catalog type 'LeaveStmtNodeSet' which
    represents an abnormal exit from a statement block or a return from a
    procedure ('abnormal' meaning not running to the end).  Also made
    corresponding attribute addition to 'StmtNodeSet' type.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the 2 catalog types ['IfThenExprMap',
    'WhenThenExprMap'] to ['IfThenMap', 'WhenThenMap'] and generalized
    their descriptions so they apply to both control flow statements as
    well as control flow expressions.  Also moved those into the "SIMPLE
    GENERIC NONSCALAR TYPES" section from the "TYPES FOR DEFINING INNER
    ROUTINE BODIES" section.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added 2 new catalog types ['IfElseStmtNodeSet',
    'GivenWhenDefStmtNodeSet'] which (together with the aforementioned 2
    renamed 'Map' types) define N-way if-else and given-when-default
    control flow statement nodes.  They are like the similarly named
    expression node kinds but for being imperative.  Also made
    corresponding attribute additions to 'StmtNodeSet' type.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added new catalog type 'LoopStmtNodeSet' which
    implements a generic looping block statement; the looping block is an
    infinite loop save for exiting when an appropriate 'LeaveStmtNodeSet'
    is invoked within it.  Also added new catalog type 'IterateStmtNodeSet'
    which will jump to the start of the next iteration of a current loop.
    Also made corresponding attribute additions to 'StmtNodeSet' type.

2008-06-28  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.37.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.37.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.37.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.31.0 and
    Routines.pod 0.27.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the catalog type 'InnerDomainType' to
    'InnerUnionType' and added new catalog type 'InnerRestrType'; the
    latter is now a more terse way to specify the common kind of type that
    is a simple subset of a single other type, either a proper subtype or a
    non-proper one that has a different default value.  Also renamed the
    'InnerDomTypeSet' type to 'InnerUniTypeSet' and added the new
    'InnerRestrTypeSet' type.  Also renamed the 'InnerNonScaTypeSet' to
    lowercase the first 'S'.  Also 'InnerTypeSet' now has 4 attributes.
    Any other catalog types which had attributes of any of the above types
    were also appropriately updated.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added 4 new catalog types ['IfElseExprNodeSet',
    'IfThenExprMap', 'GivenWhenDefExprNodeSet', 'WhenThenExprMap'] which
    collectively define N-way if-else and given-when-default control flow
    expressions.  This control flow functionality is implemented using
    special catalog types rather than generically as routines because they
    carry special short-circuit semantics such that some of their operands
    are only conditionally evaluated (which isn't true with routines in
    general), generally because some operands are determining whether we
    even know it is legal to evaluate some other operands.  Also added 2
    attributes to the 'ExprNodeSet' catalog type, ['if_else_exprs',
    'given_when_def_exprs'].

    * (Routines.pod)  Renamed or grouped the headings of a few pod
    sections, added a few as well.

    * (Routines.pod)  Added new function 'sys.std.Core.Universal.assertion'
    which is like 'treated' but that rather than a type name argument it
    takes a boolean argument; it passes through the main value argument if
    the boolean is true, and throws an exception otherwise.  This function
    exists to support arbitrary condition assertions in pure functions
    potentially at runtime or compile time without the necessesity of
    defining superfluous new types with type constraints.

    * (Routines.pod)  Added 3 new control-flow routines named
    'sys.std.Core.Control.(func|upd|proc)_invo', each of which takes a
    routine name as an argument and then invokes it with arguments given as
    another argument.  These are the fundamental routines over which other
    routines that want to invoke a routine whose name or parameters they
    might not know until runtime would do it, such as generic relational
    restriction or the map or reduction operators or try_catch.

2008-06-24  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.36.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.36.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.36.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.30.0 and
    Blob.pod and Array.pod and Rational.pod 0.27.0 and Basics.pod and
    Routines.pod and Integer.pod 0.26.0 and Ordered.pod and Text.pod and
    Relation.pod and Set.pod 0.25.0 and Bag.pod 0.24.0 and Conventions.pod
    0.3.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Array.pod)  Fixed 'limit_of_Array_from_wrap' so 2 of its parameters
    are named 'ord_(func|assuming)' and not '(func|assuming)'.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Added support for routines to have
    optional parameters in addition to non-optional parameters, rather than
    just the latter kind; when no explicit argument is given to an optional
    parameter, its value will default to the default value of its declared
    type; for subject-to-update parameters, this also results in a
    temporary variable.  In Basics.pod, added a paragraph to the pod
    section "ROUTINES" that introduces this feature.  In Types_Catalog.pod,
    added a new "opt_params" attribute to each of the 3 catalog types
    "Cat.(Func|Upd|Proc)Head", which says which parameters are optional.
    Also updated Basics.pod to say that the third "assuming" parameter of a
    "order_determination" function is now optional.

    * (Conventions.pod)  Added new pod section "Defaults and Options" which
    has suggestions concerning the use of optional parameters and default
    values for types.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Ordered.pod, Array.pod)  Added new scalar catalog
    type 'OrdDetFuncNameChain' which is the same as 'NameChain' but for
    having the different default value of 'sys.std.Core.Scalar.order'.
    Also updated every 'func' parameter of 'sys.std.Ordered.\w+' to be
    declared of the new type rather than 'NameChain'.  Likewise updated the
    declared type of 'ord_func' of 'sys.std.Array.Array_from_attr'.

    * (Routines.pod, Ordered.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod,
    Relation.pod, Set.pod, Array.pod, Bag.pod, Rational.pod)  Made some
    routine parameters optional, which are listed here; the optional
    parameters were marked in routine signatures by adding a '?' like in
    Perl 6, an example being 'foo(Bool)?'.  In Routines.pod: every
    'possrep' of 'sys.std.Core.Scalar.\w+', 'assuming' of
    'sys.std.Core.Scalar.order', every '\w*assuming' of
    'sys.std.Core.Relation.\w+', '(try|catch)_(updating|assuming)' of
    'sys.std.Core.Control.try_catch'.  In Ordered.pod: every 'func' and
    'assuming' of 'sys.std.Ordered.\w+', 'm(in|ax)_is_outside' of
    'sys.std.Ordered.is_(in|out)side_range'.  In (Integer|Rational).pod:
    'exclude_m(in|ax)' of 'sys.std.(Integer|Rational).fetch_random'.  In
    (Blob|Text).pod: 'fixed_(start|end)' of
    'sys.std.(Blob|Text).is(|_not)_substr'.  In
    (Relation|Set|Array|Bag).pod: every '\w*assuming' of
    'sys.std.(Relation|Set|Array|Bag).\w+'.  In Array.pod:
    'ord_(func|assuming)' of 'sys.std.Array.Array_from_attr'.

    * (Text.pod)  Added new pod section "FUNCTIONS FOR TEXT NORMALIZATION"
    and moved into it the 3 functions "case_folded_to_(upper|lower)" and
    "whitespace_trimmed"; also added 2 new functions in that section named
    "accents_stripped" and "ASCII".  This function group in general is
    about normalizing text such as to support operations like case or
    accent or whitespace insensitive comparison or sorting; similarly they
    are useful upon which to build an emulation of a naturally insensitive
    language over the case et al sensitive Muldis D.

    * (Text.pod)  Added new pod section "FUNCTIONS FOR PATTERN MATCHING AND
    TRANSLITERATION" with an initial complement of 2 operators
    "is(|_not)_match_using_like" that implement the full generalization of
    SQL's "(|NOT )LIKE" operators.  Later on we need to add operators for
    transliteration, and Perl regular expression matching, and so on.

    * Muldis::D version 0.35.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.35.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.35.0 and Blob.pod and Array.pod and
    Rational.pod 0.26.0 and Basics.pod and Routines.pod and PTMD_Tiny.pod
    and Integer.pod 0.25.0 and Ordered.pod and Tuple.pod and Relation.pod
    and Set.pod 0.24.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.22.0 and Temporal.pod
    0.8.1.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new "Type Safety" pod section under TYPE SYSTEM,
    which says such things that Muldis D is type safe, it is hybrid
    static/dynamic, some other things.  Also it declares that Muldis D now
    has a concept of "warnings" and some things that used to be fatal
    errors are now by default warnings instead; mainly this concerns
    fatalism concerning 'incompatible' declared types in contexts where the
    values in question are valid for the contexts.  Also updated some other
    sections under TYPE SYSTEM, and a few other spots in the file.  Also
    added new term 'warn' to the NOTES ON TERMINOLOGY section, which is
    related to but distinguished from 'fail'.

    * (Routines.pod, Ordered.pod, Tuple.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod,
    Array.pod)  Updated the documentation for several routines that stated
    failure conditions so that some of those are now warning conditions
    instead.  The primary change here is that "is_identical" now will
    always warn (and probably result in false) where it used to fail, and
    there are now no conditions where it will fail; so now the system will
    let you compare any value to any value regardless of the declared types
    of their sources; but declared types will have an affect on whether
    there is a warning or not, in case you want to be told when you compare
    an integer to a string.  Also, "assign" will now only fail if the value
    to assign isn't of the declared type of the target; it will now warn
    instead of fail if the declared type of the value isn't compatible.  A
    lot of other changes related to tuple or relation values versus
    declared types, and various other fall-out from the is-identical
    change.

    * (Relation.pod, Set.pod)  Updated the 'outer_join_with_defaults' and
    'attr_or_default' functions so that each now has an extra
    Cat.NameChain-typed argument that specifies the type to use the default
    value of; the functions no longer use the declared type of some other
    of their arguments to use the default of, since that is unreliable.

    * (Routines.pod, Relation.pod, Blob.pod)  Updated the 7 functions
    ['union', 'disjoint_union', 'intersection'; 'exclusion'; 'and', 'or',
    'xor'] so that they now fail when given zero input elements rather than
    result in an identity value; while such identities conceptually exist,
    an empty input element list lacks the information to make one, so for
    these functions the best general solution is to make the caller work
    around the zero element limitation as it sees fit (such as adding an
    identity value to the input list); adding an identity parameter instead
    was rejected as that makes the most common use cases more verbose.

    * (Relation.pod)  Deleted the 2 functions ['universal', 'negation']
    since they wouldn't have worked in the current forms; they depend on
    knowing a declared type which isn't reliably obtainable without being
    explicitly given in an extra parameter; moreover most universal
    relations would be too large to handle or infinite.  Also updated the
    'empty' function description.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Fixed a bug in the grammar of
    the 'radix' format for specifying a Rat literal; the bug was such that
    one couldn't select a non-zero rational value between -1 and +1
    exclusive; that is, one couldn't say something like "0.N".

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Refactored the grammar concerning integers and
    rationals to factor out the 3 new tokens int_max_col_val, int_body,
    pint_body.  Affected older tokens were 'int', 'count', 'rat_\w+'.

    * (Ordered.pod)  Updated the 2 "is_(in|out)side_range" functions to
    rename each of their 2 "m(in|ax)_is_inside" parameters to
    "m(in|ax)_is_outside"; and now the min|max values are included in the
    range to check against rather than being excluded.

    * (Integer.pod, Rational.pod)  Added 1 system service routine to each
    file named "sys.std.(Integer|Rational).fetch_random", respectively,
    which generates a random number using some implementation-defined
    method, which may be anywhere from truly random to pseudo-random.  The
    routines take parameters to specify the domain the generated number
    must be in, which consists of range endpoints for both routines, as
    well as a maximum precision specifier for the rational one.  In the
    future, these routines may be replaced by more that give the user some
    control over what algorithm is used to produce the random numbers, or
    to specify a seed where applicable.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Made a few typo fixes in routine signatures.

2008-06-13  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.34.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.34.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.34.0 and Temporal.pod 0.8.0.  The other
    pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * In summary, this release consists just of a rewrite of the Muldis D
    Temporal Extension, which seems to improve the complement of data types
    from before, and also adds a complement of operators, which there were
    none of before.  That said, the new version still appears to have some
    serious issues which should be dealt with in the future.  One problem
    is the combinatorial explosion of types and routines, due to desire to
    have a wall between different precisions.  Another problem concerns
    interaction of plain 'time' types and time zones, such as what
    semantics their operators should have.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Rewrote the complement of temporal data types.  In
    summary, the previous 10 temporal scalar root types were replaced by 21
    new temporal scalar root types; these new types all have a possrep each
    that is formally defined, while the old types had no possreps defined.
    For specifics: 2 'DurationOfDays(No|With)TZ' became 1 'DurationOfD', 2
    'Duration(No|With)TZ' became 1 'DurationOfFS', 2 'Date(No|With)TZ'
    became 1 'DateToD', 2 'DateTime(No|With)TZ' became 2
    'DateToFS(|WithTZ)', 2 'Time(No|With)TZ' became 2 'TimeToFS(|WithTZ)',
    4 'DurationOf(Y|M|I|S)' were added, 4 'DateTo(Y|M|I|S)' were added, 2
    'DateTo(I|S)WithTZ' were added, 4 'TimeTo(I|S)(|WithTZ)' were added.
    Also added 6 proper subtypes of 'Int' named ['NZInt', 'PInt(12|31)',
    'UInt(23|59|62)'], and 1 proper subtype of 'Rat' named 'URatLT1', to
    the Temporal Extension in order for the aforementioned new scalar root
    types to be implemented over.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Rewrote the file's DESCRIPTION pod to bring it up to
    date with current changes and plans, and it is now much larger.  The
    DESCRIPTION notes that the Muldis D Temporal Extension is not meant to
    be a complete solution for temporal data, but rather is just meant to
    be good enough to support porting databases from SQL to Muldis D
    without users having to define for themselves the temporal types that
    SQL bundles.  For more complete temporal handling, users should either
    write their own custom solutions as UDTs et al or look to third-party
    Muldis D extensions.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Added initial complement of 63 temporal math
    functions and 30 system services for getting the current date.  There
    are 18 functions named
    "sys.std.Temporal.DurationOf(Y|M|D|I|S|FS).(abs|sum|difference)", and
    18 functions named
    "sys.std.Temporal.DateTo(Y|M|D|I|S|FS).(difference|later|earlier)", and
    9 functions named
    "sys.std.Temporal.DateTo(I|S|FS)WithTZ.(difference|later|earlier)", and
    18 functions named
    "sys.std.Temporal.TimeTo(I|S|FS)(|WithTZ).(difference|later|earlier)".
    There are 12 system services named
    "sys.std.Temporal.DateTo(Y|M|D|I|S|FS).fetch_current_date_(utc|local)",
    and 6 system services named
    "sys.std.Temporal.DateTo(I|S|FS)WithTZ.fetch_current_date_(utc|local)",
    and 12 system services named
    "sys.std.Temporal.TimeTo(I|S|FS)(|WithTZ).fetch_current_time_(utc|local
    )".

2008-06-04  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.33.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.33.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.33.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.29.0 and
    Routines.pod 0.24.2 and Basics.pod 0.24.0.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added a short paragraph under TYPE SYSTEM that
    clarifies Muldis D does subtyping using "specialization by constraint"
    (not "by extension"), using those very terms.

    * (Basics.pod)  Rewrote a portion of the "Scalar Types" subsection of
    TYPE SYSTEM to bring it up to date concerning the nature of possreps,
    possrep maps, and particularly of the nature of what operators are or
    aren't built-in to types, and what are automatically system-defined.
    Also made a few other small changes in Basics or TYPE SYSTEM.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Specified that all possrep names of
    all scalar types in a common hierarchy (under the same root type) must
    have distinct names regardless of whether they share values, so to keep
    diamond inheritence more simple and deterministic.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added initial complement of catalog types that
    define controls for mounting and unmounting depots, in the new main pod
    section "TYPES FOR DEFINING MOUNT CONTROLS"; this consists of the 2 new
    types "Cat.MountControl(Cat|Set)".  This fills in one of the arguably
    very few remaining gaps in essential language functionality.  Some
    standard customizations per depot mount include readonly vs updateable,
    temporary or not, create on mount or not; most customizations are left
    to implementation-specific 'details' though, such as file names or
    authentication credentials.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod)  Added new routine kind
    "type_default" in the ROUTINES main section, so to formalize the
    concept of a zero-parameter function that always results in a certain
    value of a type.  Updated documentation for the 'Universal.default'
    function, and for catalog type attributes of that kind of function, to
    use that name.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Added new routine kind "possrep_map"
    in the ROUTINES main section, so to formalize the concept of a 1:1
    mapping function used in scalar type definitions; updated the relevant
    type-defining catalog type docs accordingly.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the 'Cat.PossrepSet' type so that its
    'constraint' attribute may be less restricting than otherwise when
    there are multiple possreps in the same scalar (|sub)type; the total
    constraint on a type is the 'and'-ing of all of its possrep
    constraints, so each individual one in general only needs to restrict
    enough that inter-possrep map funcs can work, and the other constraints
    can be applied too.  (This detail is subject to revision.)  Also
    updated all of the inner types to specify that their '*constraint'
    attributes default to be unconditionally true, unlike the inner-func
    default of unconditionally false.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the 'Cat.InnerDomainType' type so that
    it must have at least 1 source type rather than at least none, and
    updated the handling of filter types so they default to union rather
    than intersect; also renamed the is_filter_union attribute to
    is_filter_intersection; also clarified that it is invalid to declare a
    domain type that is an alias of 'Empty' due to needing a default value.

    * (Basics.pod)  In a reversal of one aspect of release 0.9.0, updated
    ROUTINES to bring back the distinct 'state_constraint' routine kind,
    and rewrote it so it is now the same as a 'type_constraint', being a
    pure function with 1 parameter rather than a routine that can see
    globals.  Also updated the definitions of 'type_constraint' and
    'transition_constraint' to conform to recent catalog formalizations;
    the first one now always just takes the single 'topic' parameter.  And
    all constraints must not unconditionally result in Bool:false.  Note
    that the catalog still doesn't define how to apply state or transition
    constraints to variables; such an update is pending.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added new type 'Cat.ConstraintSet' which defines
    a set of named generalized constraints (type or state or transition
    etc; technically its a named set of InnerFuncBody).  Updated the 2
    types 'Cat.Inner(Nonscalar|Domain)Type' to pluralize the names of their
    generic constraint attributes, and those attributes' types are now the
    ConstraintSet type rather than the InnerFuncBody type.  The net result
    of these changes is that type constraints, on particularly
    tuple|relation|database types, can now be split into N named pieces,
    which should make them easier to write when complicated, and make
    debugging or input validation easier since the name of each smaller
    constraint would be in the exception resulting from its failure.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added support for an abstraction for defining
    distributed (unique) keys over relation-valued attributes of a
    tuple/database type.  Added 3 new types Cat.DistribKeySet,
    Cat.DKMemRelAttrMap, Cat.DKRelAttrKeyAttrMap which define distributed
    keys, and added 1 new DistribKeySet-typed attribute named
    'distrib_keys' to the 'Cat.InnerNonscalarType' type.

    * Muldis::D version 0.32.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.32.0.tar.gz.

    * Renamed Sequence.pod to Array.pod; the entities it declares have all
    been renamed to "sys.std.Array.\w+" from "sys.std.Sequence.\w+".  Any
    references to these in other files [D.pm, Core.pod, Relation.pod, the
    README file] were updated accordingly.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.32.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.28.0 and
    Types.pod and Blob.pod and Array.pod 0.25.0 and Routines.pod 0.24.1 and
    PTMD_Tiny.pod and Text.pod 0.24.0 and Relation.pod 0.23.1 and
    Basics.pod 0.23.0 and Core.pod 0.21.2 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.21.0.
    The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod, Routines.pod)  Made a few typo fixes.

    * (Basics.pod)  In the NOTES ON TERMINOLOGY main pod section, updated
    the 'sequence' entry to add 'array' as a synonym for it.  Rather than
    avoiding the use of 'array' altogether given its more broad meaning in
    wider contexts like any indexed list, including associative arrays, we
    now simply say that those other meanings aren't used in this
    documentation, and only the meaning of an ordered collection applies.
    Also added a related item 'sequence generator' to the above entry, and
    specified that only the longer term refers to a sequence generator, and
    that 'sequence' by itself does not.

    * (Types.pod)  Renamed the 2 core types '(|Quasi)Seq' to
    '(|Quasi)Array'.  The change to use Array rather than Seq was done for
    3 main reasons, the first of which was to make the type name more
    visually distinctive from the Set type; the second reason was because
    the overwhelming majority of other languages used the name Array, and
    its not like I was using the term for anything else, and its not like
    my reason for avoiding it before was particularly good; the third
    reason was to reduce confusion about the type name referring to a
    sequence generator, as SQL users may think.  As a fourth reason, this
    change had the side-effect that the associated language extension and
    its entities now have shorter names; Array from Sequence; and the
    extension name Sequence is now freed up for possible use related to a
    sequence generator.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the 2 types '(|Decl)NameChain' so that
    their 'seq' possrep is now named 'array'.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated the literal syntax for
    '(|Quasi)Array' values to use the type's new name, and updated the
    literal syntax for '(|Decl)NameChain' values so that their new possrep
    name is used.

    * (Basics.pod)  In the "Referencing Data Types" pod section under
    ENTITY NAMES, updated the spelling for '(|quasi_)seq_of' to be
    '(|quasi_)array_of', in accordance with the type name changes.

    * (Array.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod)  Updated any
    routine signatures or nonscalar type definitions that used
    'Seq'|'seq_of' to use 'Array'|'array_of' instead.  In Array.pod, also
    renamed the 2 'is_(|not_)subseq' functions to 'is_(|not_)subarray'.

    * (Routines.pod, Relation.pod)  Updated any references on 'Seq' in the
    documentation to 'Array'; these are only description pod updates.

    * (Array.pod)  Removed 'last_index' as it seems to be less useful than
    previously thought; it isn't really a short-hand for 'cardinality'
    since to make it work also with empty sequences, it would need to
    result in a Maybe or be wrapped in tests.

2008-05-20  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.31.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.31.0.tar.gz.

    * Split apart Nonscalar.pod 2 ways into Tuple.pod and Relation.pod; the
    first file got the 4 "sys.std.Nonscalar.Tuple.\w+" named functions
    (grouped in 1 pod section), and the second file got all the remaining,
    27 "sys.std.Nonscalar.Relation.\w+" named functions (grouped in 4 pod
    sections); following the split, the functions were renamed to
    "sys.std.Tuple.\w+" and "sys.std.Relation.\w+", respectively.  Any
    references to these in other files [D.pm, Core.pod, the README file]
    were updated accordingly.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.31.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.27.0 and
    Rational.pod 0.25.0 and Types.pod and Routines.pod and Sequence.pod
    0.24.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod and Ordered.pod and Tuple.pod and Relation.pod
    0.23.0 and Basics.pod 0.22.0 and Core.pod 0.21.1 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    0.20.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod)  Fixed a few fossils.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the main pod sections "TYPES FOR
    DEFINING ENTITY NAMES AND COMMENTS" and "SIMPLE GENERIC CATALOG
    COLLECTION TYPES" to "SIMPLE GENERIC (|NON)SCALAR TYPES", respectively.

    * (Routines.pod)  Added new "SYSTEM-DEFINED GENERIC SCALAR-CONCERNING
    FUNCTIONS" main pod section, along with a complete complement of
    generic scalar possrep attribute extraction and updating functions.
    These 7 "sys.std.Core.Scalar.\w+" functions were added, which take
    advantage of the fact that a scalar possrep looks just like a tuple:
    '(|update_)attr', 'multi_update', '(|cmpl_)projection',
    'Tuple_from_Scalar', 'Scalar_from_Tuple'.

    * (Rational.pod)  Removed the now-redundant (with 'Scalar.\w+') 7
    rational numeric specific value selection and possrep attribute
    extraction functions: 'Rat_from_Int_(pair|triple)', 'numerator',
    'denominator', 'mantissa', 'radix', 'exponent'.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new "Ordered Types" pod section under the TYPE
    SYSTEM main section.  It outlines the system-defined support for
    order-sensitive operators and related best practices.  Values of any
    type can be explicitly sorted, but only scalar root types can have a
    default sorting function defined for them.  Currently, only functions
    for total ordering have privileged support, but partial ordering
    functions can be user-defined over such.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new routine kind "order_determination" in the
    ROUTINES main section, so that the concept of a "system-compatible
    fundamental order-determination function" can now be referred to by a
    terse name in the rest of the documentation.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  In a reversal
    of one aspect of release 0.19.0, brought back the then-removed
    Cat.Order enumerated scalar type, but enhanced to have 2 possreps
    rather than none (one over 'Name', one over 'Int'); also brought back
    the literal syntax specific to this type in both Tiny dialects, but
    sans any 'Cat.' prefix; also both dialects now provide for direct
    analogies to both possreps.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod)  Updated the 'Cat.InnerScalarType'
    type to add a 7th attribute named 'order' which defines an optional
    type-default total ordering function, which can only be defined with a
    root type.  Added generic scalar function 'sys.std.Core.Scalar.order'
    which externalizes this function, and it is what other order-sensitive
    operators can wrap when dealing with values of such scalar types.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Rational.pod)  Updated the
    descriptions of the 10 types [Bool, Int, Blob, Text, Cat.Name,
    Cat.NameChain, Cat.DeclNameChain, Cat.Comment, Cat.Order, Rat] to
    explicitly declare that each one has a type-default ordering algorithm,
    and to describe what that algorithm is.  Also stated that the
    RatRoundMeth type does *not* have a default ordering.  (Still TODO is
    to address the temporal and spatial types in one of these manners.)

    * (Ordered.pod)  Updated all of this language extension's
    "order_determination"-wrapping functions to have the 2 extra parameters
    "func" and "assuming", so that they can be customized as to what
    fundamental function they wrap, whether one defined with the comparand
    types or otherwise.  Also added the function
    'sys.std.Ordered.reverse_order'.  Also, 'min' and 'max' no longer
    result in an identity value with zero topic elements.

    * (Relation.pod)  Added new main pod section "SYSTEM-DEFINED RELATIONAL
    RANKING AND QUOTA FUNCTIONS" with an initial complement of the 2
    "sys.std.Relation.(rank|limit)" generic relational operators.  The
    "rank" function will extend the topic relation with an integer column
    with the tuples ranked 0..N, that order determined by an
    "order_determination"-function argument that it wraps; its
    functionality is essentially SQL's "RANK" but the ordering is only
    total, so no dense / not dense distinction.  This "rank" function
    provides the basis of both arbitrary quota queries as well as making
    lists sorted.  The "limit" function provides a specific kind of quota
    query, in doing a restriction on the topic relation to a consecutive
    range of tuples ranked as per "rank"; its functionality is like SQL's
    "ORDER BY" plus "LIMIT" but the result is not a sequence.

    * (Sequence.pod)  Added the 2
    "sys.std.Sequence.(|limit_of_)Seq_from_wrap" functions, which are
    essentially the same as the above rank|limit but that the result is a
    sequence rather than a generic relation.  Prefer the sequence versions
    when immediately returning the sorted query results, versus prefer the
    rank|limit versions when using their results as a subquery in a larger
    relational query.  Also added "Seq_from_attr", which together with
    "Seq_from_wrap" are analogies to similar Set and Bag functions.  Also
    added the 2 functions "last_index" and "slice".

    * (Routines.pod)  Removed the empty main pod section "SYSTEM-DEFINED
    CORE CATALOG FUNCTIONS"; catalog-specific routines will instead go in a
    new Core/Routines_Catalog.pod file when they come to be.

    * Muldis::D version 0.30.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.30.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.30.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.26.0 and
    Integer.pod and Blob.pod and Rational.pod 0.24.0 and Types.pod 0.23.1
    and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.22.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.19.0 and
    Conventions.pod 0.2.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Fixed a few fossils.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Refactored the catalog types for defining outer
    data types.  The oft-repeated attribute triple
    "inner_(sca|non_sca|dom)_types" was factored out into the new tuple
    (database) type Cat.InnerTypeSet, and a single "inner_types" attribute
    of that type is now used in the outer routine and type defining types
    rather than the triple.  The 3 "Cat.(Scalar|Nonscalar|Domain)Type"
    types were combined into the 1 "Cat.Type" type; now an outer type must
    have at least 1 inner type, which defines the outer type, and that
    inner type has the empty string for its name; this arrangement is akin
    to an expression node hierarchy.  Along with that, the 9
    "Cat.(Sys|Dep|Pkg)(Sca|NonSca|Dom)TypeSet" types were combined into the
    3 "Cat.(Sys|Dep|Pkg)TypeSet" types, and the corresponding 3 attributes
    in each of "Cat.(System|Depot|Package)" were consolidated into 1
    attribute for each.

    * (Rational.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the
    rational extension enumerated type "E_RM"/"Cat.E_RM" to just
    "RatRoundMeth", and also updated its literal syntax in both Tiny
    dialects likewise.

    * (Rational.pod)  Updated the "RatRoundMeth" type so that it explicitly
    has a possrep that wraps the Cat.Name type, rather than implicitly
    having no possreps.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Abbreviated the literal syntax
    for scalar catalog types in both Tiny dialects so that the literals no
    longer have a leading "Cat."; this affects the 4 types: Name,
    NameChain, DeclNameChain, Comment; but with Name it only affects the
    documentation since its literals had no 'Name' prefix to begin with.

    * (Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Rational.pod)  Updated the documentation so
    that any types declared by these files which were referred to with a
    "Cat." prefix now aren't; the affected types were "RatRoundRule" and
    several "PInt\d\w+".

    * (Conventions.pod)  Removed the suggestion about enumerated types
    being named like E_FOO; for one thing, no system-defined enums do that
    anymore; also that format may be too terse for general practice.

2008-05-11  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.29.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.29.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.29.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.25.0 and
    Types.pod and Routines.pod and Integer.pod and Blob.pod and Text.pod
    and Set.pod and Sequence.pod and Bag.pod and Rational.pod 0.23.0 and
    Nonscalar.pod 0.22.0 and Basics.pod and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.21.0 and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.18.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new "User Namespace Correspondence" pod section
    under ENTITY NAMES.  It says how the namespaces *.lib and *.data
    inter-relate, for example when they need to have corresponding sections
    and when they need to have non-conflicting ones.  Also, when a depot
    has no subdepots or packages, then its "dep.data" is "just a database".

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new "Referencing Data Types" pod section under
    ENTITY NAMES.  It specifies a couple new language features, the first
    of which lets you directly reference types that were baked into the
    external interfaces of other entities like variables or routines, as if
    they were normal explicitly declared types; also you can simply take
    the corresponding tuple type for a relation type or vice-versa; the
    second feature is that you can tersely declare simple collection types
    inline, such as sets or sequences of Foo, saving the language and users
    from a proliferation of explicitly declared simple (|quasi-)nonscalar
    types like "MaybeOfInt" or "SeqOfText".

    * (Types.pod)  Removed the 6 explicitly declared tuple type factories
    "(|Quasi)(Set|Seq|Bag)Elem", which are now superfluous as you should
    now be able to use the "tuple_from" syntax on the
    "(|Quasi)(Set|Seq|Bag)" type factories instead, if you need them.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod,
    Rational.pod)  Removed the 38 explicitly declared 'Of' types which are
    now superfluous: 24
    "(Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag)Of(Bool|Int|UInt|Blob|Text|Rat)", 4
    "(Set|Bag)Of(Tuple|Relation)", SetOfBag, MaybeOfTuple, SeqOfSeq, 2
    "QuasiSetOf(Tuple|Relation)", SeqOfProcStmt, 4
    "SetOf(Name|NameExprMap|SetOfName|NameChain)".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod,
    Nonscalar.pod, Set.pod, Sequence.pod, Bag.pod, Rational.pod)  Updated
    all references to the aforementioned deleted 'Of' types, in type
    attributes and routine signatures, to refer to the implicitly generated
    '_of' versions instead.  In Types_Catalog.pod, this also means that the
    whole SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE QUASI-CATALOG PARAMETERIZED TYPES pod section
    was eliminated.

    * (Types.pod)  Updated descriptions of the Database and Single types.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the 4
    "Cat.(System|Federation|Depot|Package)" types to ensure that they
    actually are "Database" types and not "just Tuple" types, since each
    "cat" variable is supposed to be a valid "database".  The only change
    for each of the 4 types was to convert type of its "comment" attribute
    from "Cat.Comment" (a scalar) to "single_of.Cat.Comment" (a relation);
    the latter type was also added under the misc collection types section.
    Also clarified that the "Cat.ExprNodeSet" type qualifies as a db type.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the 4 "Cat.Sys(Nsp|Func|Upd|Proc)Set"
    types to flesh out the definition of their 'parent' attributes (which
    had been left 'TODO'), and expanded the description of the "namespaces"
    attribute of the "Cat.System" type.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Refactored
    the catalog types for defining data types.  Previously, there was just
    the single "Cat.Type" main type, plus 2 supporting enumerated types,
    that handled all of special types, root scalar and nonscalar types,
    domain types and union etc types.  Now "Cat.Type" has been replaced
    with mainly these 9 types: Cat.(|Inner)(Scalar|Nonscalar|Domain)Type,
    Cat.Possrep(|Map)Set, Cat.KeySet; they handle all of the aforementioned
    but for special types.  There are 3 main type definition methods for
    user-defined types, each of which is represented by an outer/inner
    pair; the inners do all the work and outers are just wrappers for those
    to make them explicit depot etc entities; multiple inners can be in an
    outer, all but one playing support to the one, and inner types also can
    be embedded in outer routines.  With Cat.Type gone, the 2 enumerated
    types Cat.E_TK and Cat.E_TDM were no longer useful and were eliminated;
    along with their types, the special literal syntax for Cat.E_TK and
    Cat.E_TDM was eliminated from the 2 Tiny dialects.  Added the 9
    Cat.(Sys|Dep|Pkg)(Sca|NonSca|Dom)TypeSet types and updated the
    Cat.(System|Depot|Package) types to each have 3 corresponding
    attributes, rather than each having a placeholder 'types' attribute.
    Added the 3 Cat.Inner(Sca|NonSca|Dom)TypeSet types and updated the
    Cat.(Func|Upd|Proc)Body types to each have 3 corresponding attributes,
    rather than each having a placeholder 'inner_types' attribute; the 3
    new outer type types each have the 3 corresponding attributes also.
    Also added the 2 Cat.Sys(Spec|ScaNPR)TypeSet types and updated the
    Sys.System type to have 2 corresponding attributes; these list the
    special system-defined types of the kinds that users can't make.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added 2 catalog types for defining dbvars, both
    of the catalog and user data variety: Cat.DbVar, Cat.SysCatSet. Updated
    the catalog types Cat.(System|Depot|Package) to have a 'catalog' or
    'data' attribute each rather than a placeholder.  With this, all the
    explicit TODO placeholders in Types_Catalog.pod are now gone.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  The placeholder catalog type Cat.Exception was
    not addressed yet, and for now has been removed; it will come back
    later; so the whole OLD TYPE DEFINITIONS TO REWRITE OR REPLACE pod
    section was eliminated.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  The statement terminator semicolon no longer exists;
    it was never needed to help parsing and its presence would probably
    have confused people.  Also added whitespace allowance between main
    parts of rational literals.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added DESCRIPTION paragraph to point out that the
    PTMD_Tiny dialect is designed for a single-pass parser or lexer, and so
    it should be possible to parse such code simply and with little RAM;
    also a paragraph about the flexibility programmers have for writing
    code in the dialect, such as matters of whitespace.

    * Muldis::D version 0.28.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.28.1.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.28.1 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.24.2 and
    Types.pod and Routines.pod and Ordered.pod and Integer.pod and Blob.pod
    and Text.pod and Set.pod and Sequence.pod and Bag.pod and Rational.pod
    0.22.1 and Nonscalar.pod 0.21.1 and Basics.pod 0.20.2 and PTMD_Tiny.pod
    0.20.1 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.17.1 and Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod
    0.7.1.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * Completed the system entity renaming that began in release 0.27.0,
    such that all fully-qualified references to types and routines in the
    'sys.[A-Z]\w+' namespace have been renamed into the 'sys.std.[A-Z]\w+'
    namespace.  This was the only change made for release 0.28.1.  To be
    specific, the usage of 'sys.std' was already official in 0.27.0, and it
    was just that most documentation was out of date until now.

2008-05-01  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.28.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.28.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.28.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.24.1 and
    Basics.pod 0.20.1 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.20.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    0.17.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Seq literals now use square brackets as list
    delimiters rather than curly braces like most literals.  It was decided
    to standardize on using square brackets to delimit the few lists where
    the order of elements in the literal is significant, while leaving the
    curly braces for the majority lists where the order is not significant.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  All the separator and list delimiter tokens (that
    are outside character string literals) now allow whitespace around
    them, which can help you wrap long lines.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Character string literals may now be divided into
    1..N consecutive character string literal segments which are separated
    by the (whitespace delimited) segment stitching character '~' (tilde);
    this can help you wrap long character strings into multiple lines.
    Likewise, blob literals can now be segmented using the same token.  Now
    we could have tried likewise with numeric literals too, but decided not
    for simplicity, as the odds of that being used are next to none.  Also
    the flat formats for name chains can not be segmented; if you have one
    that long, then use the sequence format for name chains instead.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added another format for generic
    relation literals that is more compact than the other main form due to
    only stating attribute names once rather than repeating them per tuple;
    the trade-off is that attribute values per tuple and their names are
    now mapped by ordinal position in the literal so attribute order is not
    immaterial; mutual order of whole tuples still is immaterial though.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Fixed a few fossils.

2008-04-27  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.27.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.27.0.tar.gz.

    * Removed the very incomplete file Hierarchical.pod, as it has become
    more superfluous given the other Tiny dialects becoming more terse and
    better for regular use.  Not that other dialects can't be introduced
    later, but they aren't as necessary now.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.27.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.24.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.20.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.19.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    0.16.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (D.pm, Basics.pod)  In the ENTITY NAMES section of Basics.pod,
    refactored the builtins namespaces to unify them under 'sys'; so what
    used to be ['cat','sys','imp'] are now ['sys.cat','sys.std','sys.imp']
    respectively.  The VERSIONING section of D.pm had a corresponding
    update.  However, all the standard Muldis D routine and type
    definitions or references in the Core/* and Ext/* and Dialect/* etc
    files were *not* updated yet to the new naming scheme; those
    documentation files will be updated piecemeal instead when they already
    need to be updated for some other reason, especially for a related
    global change; meanwhile, though most pod doesn't show it, the new
    'sys.std' names are the actual official ones.  Also, 'mnt' was split
    into itself and 'mnt.cat', the latter being where the system catalog
    for controlling depot mounts actually now is.

    * (Basics.pod)  In the ENTITY NAMES section, public-invokable types
    and routines no longer have to be confined in packages, but can exist
    directly in a depot or subdepot instead.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added generic literal syntax for
    selecting a value of any scalar or quasi-scalar type which has at least
    1 possrep.  The syntax is similar to a tuple literal, but rather than
    being "Tuple:{ <attr names and values> }" it is "Scalar:<type
    name>:<possrep name>:{ <possrep attr names and values> }".  This
    feature fills in a useability hole where previously it wasn't possible
    to have literals of most scalar types in a bootloader, and such values
    required the writing of a whole (temporary) routine to generate them.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the literal syntax for a Cat.NameChain so
    its 'seq' representation now has square brackets around the name parts.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Refactored
    the catalog types for defining value expressions and routine
    statements.  Routine parameters and variables are now invokable
    directly in expressions and statements, and are no longer invokable by
    way of 'param' or 'var' etc expression nodes.  Expression nodes and
    parameters and variables are now invoked using Cat.NameChain rather
    than Cat.Name (the implementing change was in Cat.NameExprMap), which
    allows you both to access their attributes with minimal syntax, but
    also normalizes the syntax for local and global variable access.  The 2
    types Cat.ProcStmtArg(|Set) were eliminated since, following the above
    changes, Cat.NameExprMap could be used instead for defining procedure
    statement arguments; then the Cat.E_PSAK enumerated type had no more
    uses, and was eliminated.  The 2 types Cat.(|Multi)UpdStmt were merged
    into the 1 type Cat.MultiUpdStmt, which otherwise is essentially the
    same as the old version.  The 3 types Cat.Expr(Node|Set|Tree) were
    refactored into the 6 types
    Cat.(|(Sca|ScaPR|Tup|Rel)Lit|FuncInvo)ExprNodeSet; the first of those
    is a tuple with 5 attributes, one each of the other 5 of those, which
    are relations; so then an inner routine that used to have a
    Cat.Expr(Set|Tree) attribute now has a Cat.ExprNodeSet attribute
    instead; then the Cat.E_ENK enumerated type had no more uses, and was
    eliminated.  With the previous changes, code for expressions or
    statements no longer has any inapplicable attributes, save relations
    allowed to be empty.  Along with their types, the special literal
    syntax for Cat.E_ENK and Cat.E_PSAK was eliminated from the 2 Tiny
    dialects.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added new
    scalar type Cat.DeclNameChain, as well as its own literal syntax in
    both Tiny dialects.  This type is the same as Cat.NameChain except that
    it allows 0..N name parts rather than 2..N, and its flat possrep also
    has periods before and after the parts rather than just between them.
    This type was added for use when declaring subdepots, depot entities.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added a set of 4 top-level catalog types which
    are the types of the Muldis D catalog dbvars: Cat.System (for
    'sys.cat'), Cat.Federation (for 'fed.cat'), Cat.Depot (for 'dep.cat'
    and 'sdp.cat'), Cat.Package (for 'pkg.cat').  Added a set of 2 catalog
    types which define nodes in N-depth namespace hierarchies for
    organizing entities within a catalog: Cat.SysNspSet (hierarchies for
    system-defined entities), Cat.SubdepotSet (hierarchies for user-defined
    entities, for example SQL 'schema'); these 2 only declare that
    namespaces exist, not what entities are in them.  Added a set of 11
    catalog types which specify/embed the definitions of entities in
    catalog dbvars: Cat.DepotMountSet (what depot mounts are in a mount
    federation), Cat.PackageSet (what packages are in a depot),
    Cat.Sys(Func|Upd|Proc)Set (what system-defined routines there are),
    Cat.(Dep|Pkg)(Func|Upd|Proc)Set (what user-defined routines there are,
    directly in a depot or in a package of a depot, respectively); for the
    system-defined routines, only the routine headings/interfaces are
    specified, and for user-defined ones, both those and the
    bodies/implementations are specified.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Refactored the catalog types for defining
    main|outer and inner routines, so that routine headings and bodies are
    now separate from each other, and routine declared names are now
    external to both parts; that is, a routine's name, if it has one, is
    supplied by whatever other type embeds the otherwise anonymous routine
    definition.  The 11 types Cat.(|Inner)(Func|Updater|Proc) and
    Cat.Inner(Func|Updater)(Set|Tree) and Cat.InnerProcTree were refactored
    into the 12 types Cat.(Func|Upd|Proc)(Head|Body) and
    Cat.Inner(Func|Upd|Proc)(Body|Set).  Following this refactoring plus
    the previous change item, the 'name' attribute for named functions is
    directly in each of the 12 Cat.(Sys|Dep|Pkg|Inner)(Func|Upd|Proc)Set
    types; all 12 have a 'head' attribute and all but the Sys have a 'body'
    attribute, those embedding appropriate Head and Body types, the 3
    together completely defining the routine.  Both outer and inner
    routines of the same kind use the same Head types, but have their own
    Body types.  Another change this refactoring brought is that an outer
    routine no longer requires an inner routine to define its own
    interface; now an outer routine body embeds its implementation detail
    (still an inner routine Body) directly, rather than it being a list
    item in an inner routines list whose name is the empty string;
    therefore, outer routines no longer need to have inner routines at all
    unless they do certain things.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Despite the widescale refactoring, these 10
    catalog types transitioned from the previous to the current design
    while retaining their names and purpose, and also all or most of their
    own design details: Cat.Name, Cat.NameChain, Cat.Comment,
    Cat.SeqOfProcStmt, Cat.ProcStmt, Cat.NameTypeMap, NameExprMap,
    AttrRenameMap, SetOfName, Cat.SetOfNameExprMap.  Also some minor typo
    fixes with a few of the 9 QuasiCat type docs, but the whole block was
    left alone and still fits in fine.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  The following 6 catalog types were not addressed
    yet and still need to be rewritten/refactored: Cat.E_TK, Cat.E_TDM,
    Cat.Type, Cat.Exception, Cat.SetOfSetOfName, Cat.SetOfNameChain.  More
    generally speaking, the catalog types for defining data types (and
    databases) still need to be rewritten, or actually they mostly need to
    be written in the first place.  Hopefully by the next Muldis D release.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  In the process of the other changes, the 3
    largest main documentation sections, "SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE CATALOG (
    SCALAR | TUPLE | RELATION ) DATA TYPES", were reorganized into the 10
    main documentation sections "TYPES FOR DEFINING ( ENTITY NAMES AND
    COMMENTS | SYSTEM-DEFINED ENTITIES | FEDERATIONS | DEPOTS AND SUBDEPOTS
    | PACKAGES | ROUTINE HEADINGS | ROUTINE BODIES | INNER ROUTINE BODIES
    )" and "SIMPLE GENERIC CATALOG COLLECTION TYPES" and "OLD TYPE
    DEFINITIONS TO REWRITE OR REPLACE".

2008-04-21  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.26.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.26.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.26.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.23.0 and
    Routines.pod 0.22.0 and Basics.pod 0.19.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.18.0 and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.15.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the routine kind 'main' to
    'bootloader' and updated its description.  This routine kind is now not
    so much a "main program" as it is more like a thin wrapper that loads
    and invokes the main from a depot.  A bootloader can be used by both
    plain text and hosted data Muldis D, not just the former; it can also
    be split into pieces.  Also added the bootloader_exclusive routine kind
    which is a system service that can only be called by a bootloader,
    examples being distinct transaction initiation and termination
    statements.  Most updates were in the ROUTINES and TRANSACTIONS AND
    CONCURRENCY and RESOURCE MODULARITY AND PERSISTENCE sections of
    Basics.pod, and in the DESCRIPTION of PTMD_Tiny.pod.

    * (Routines.pod)  Added new SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE BOOTLOADER EXCLUSIVES
    with 3 new sys.Core.Control.(start|commit|rollback)_trans routines.

    * (Basics.pod)  In the ENTITY NAMES section, refactored the
    fed|dep|sdp|pkg namespaces so that each has cat|lib|data secondary
    namespaces.  The 'lib' namespace retains the type and routine
    invocation names while 'data' now represents a dbvar and it replaces
    all the '<relvar>'; this change was made to emphasize the fact that
    there is just a single global variable (per scope) for user data, and
    that relvars are just pseudo-variable components of a dbvar.  The new
    'cat' secondary namespaces, each a dbvar, are now the parts of the
    system catalog for user-defined entities, and the 'cat' primary
    namespace is now just a dbcon for system-defined entities.  Added new
    'mnt' primary namespace catalog dbvar to countrol what depot mounts
    exist, rather than that being under the 'cat' primary.  Also indicated
    that type definitions can have inner routines, and routine definitions
    can have inner types; that is there are both inner and outer types now.

    * (Basics.pod)  In ENTITY NAMES, added "Terse Pseudo-Variable Syntax"
    section which specifies that you can indeed use extended entity names
    to directly reference components of eg tuples, such as by writing
    "tupvar.attrname" rather than having to say "attr( tupvar, attrname )"
    or "assign( tupvar.attrname, 42 )" rather than "assign( tupvar,
    update_attr( tupvar, attrname, 42 ) )".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Formalized
    the Cat.NameChain type with actual possrep names, and updated it to
    require a minimum of 2 chain elements; also deleted the superfluous
    types Cat.NESeqOfName and Cat.FlattenedNameChain, which have been
    merged into Cat.NameChain as informal inner types.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Supplemented the HDMD_Perl_Tiny
    dialect so you can define whole bootloader routines in it as you
    already could with the PTMD_Tiny dialect; added 2 new pod sections /
    PHMD node types BOOTLOADER and BOOTLOADER PROCEDURE CALL.  Updated the
    PTMD_Tiny dialect to rename the 'start' token to 'bootloader', and
    'procedure_call' to 'bootloader_procedure_call'; the latter now starts
    with the literal text 'boot_call' rather than 'Call'.

    * Muldis::D version 0.25.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.25.1.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.25.1 and Basics.pod 0.18.1 and
    SeeAlso.pod 0.4.1.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (D.pm, Basics.pod, SeeAlso.pod)  A few minor updates to reflect the
    fact that the Muldis D main reference implementation is now named
    Muldis Rosetta rather than Muldis DB.

2008-04-07  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.25.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.25.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.25.0 and Types.pod and
    Types_Catalog.pod and Ordered.pod and Integer.pod and Blob.pod and
    Text.pod and Set.pod and Sequence.pod and Bag.pod and Rational.pod
    0.22.0 and Basics.pod 0.18.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.17.0 and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.14.0 and Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod 0.7.0.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (D.pm)  The TRADEMARK POLICY section was severely edited to excise
    most legalese, and is now just half its previous size; the old longer
    version was shunted off to the Muldis Data Systems' website.

    * (D.pm, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the quasi-constant
    second (authority) part of a fully-qualified name format for a Muldis D
    language variant, applicable only to the official/original (not
    embraced and extended) variants, from 'cpan:DUNCAND' to
    'http://muldis.com'.  This is because the main web address of Muldis
    Data Systems more closely represents the official authority on Muldis
    D, rather than CPAN which is more just a forum for publishing it.

    * (Basics.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the "main" routine kind to
    specify that it can not have any lexical variables or inner routines;
    all a "main" can do is invoke procedures that have no subject-to-update
    parameters.

    * (Basics.pod)  The standard system-defined entities may now have fully
    qualified names that are 3 or more parts (including the "sys") rather
    than exactly 4 parts, which allows for more elegant naming schemes.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, Integer.pod,
    Blob.pod, Text.pod, Rational.pod, Temporal.pod, Spatial.pod)  Renamed
    all the data types declared in Types.pod to substitute 'Type' for
    '(Universal|((|Quasi)(Scalar|Tuple|Relation)|Remnant|Spec)'; then
    renamed the 4 'D0' types to distinguish them again, and renamed 'E_D'
    to 'QuasiScalarDVPT'.  Renamed all the data types declared in
    Types_Catalog.pod to insert a '.Type' before their '.(|Quasi)Cat'.
    Then all the Core types were named 'sys.Core.Type(|.(|Quasi)Cat).\w+'.
    Renamed all the data types declared in
    (Integer|Blob|Text|Rational|Spatial).pod so that they have names like
    'sys.<extension>.Type.\w+'; the previous 3rd name part was either
    redundant with the extension name or was '(Cat|Spec)'.  Renamed all the
    data types declared in Temporal.pod from 'sys.Temporal.(With|No)TZ.\w+'
    to 'sys.Temporal.Type.\w+(With|No)TZ'.

    * (Ordered.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod, Set.pod, Sequence.pod,
    Bag.pod, Rational.pod)  Renamed all the routines whose third name parts
    were redundant with their second name parts, to remove the third parts.

    * (Types.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod)  Removed the system-defined
    types NE(Blob|Text) and updated the few system-defined functions using
    them to use Blob|Text instead.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod)  Removed the
    Cat.PInt2_36 type from the core and placed duplicate copies of it under
    altered names in both the integer and rational extensions.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the DESCRIPTION, as well as the Name and
    Comment descriptions.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated the
    Cat.E_ENK and Cat.E_PSAK types to remove each of their 'default'
    values.  Users now always specify the use of type-default values
    explicitly, using either generic literal or function invocation
    expressions, which makes user code more self-documenting and saves on
    some catalog complexity; that said, some Muldis D dialects may still
    have a short-hand for 'default'.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the Cat.ExprNode and Cat.ProcStmtArg
    types to remove each of their 'type' attributes.  Users now always do
    an explicit 'treated' func call when they need to, or otherwise the
    data type at each of these nodes is now just inferred from context, and
    so Muldis D is now more like a typical programming language as to what
    it requires users to explicitly say.

2008-03-22  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.24.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.24.0.tar.gz.

    * What was Language-MuldisD at version 0.23.0 has been renamed to
    Muldis-D.  This is the first release of the Muldis-D distribution, and
    the first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 package names
    like Muldis::D(|::\w+).  All of the files in this distribution are as
    identical as possible to how they were when last released under the
    names Language::MuldisD(|::\w+) but for the name changes.  All lib/
    files were renamed appropriately, and also the one t/LMD_00_Compile.t
    was renamed to t/Muldis_D_00_Compile.t.

    * All versioned files had their version numbers incremented to the
    first higher 0.N.0.  New file versions are: D.pm 0.24.0 and Core.pod
    and Types.pod and Types_Catalog.pod and Routines.pod and Ordered.pod
    and Integer.pod and Blob.pod and Text.pod and Nonscalar.pod and Set.pod
    and Sequence.pod and Bag.pod and Rational.pod 0.21.0 and Basics.pod
    0.17.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.16.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.13.0 and
    Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod 0.6.0 and SeeAlso.pod 0.4.0 and
    Hierarchical.pod and Conventions.pod 0.1.0.

    * Updated D.pm and the README file to clarify that commercial support
    is available from the author specifically by way of Muldis Data
    Systems.

    * Updated all .pm and .pod files to add a new TRADEMARK POLICY section
    near the end of each; it serves for trademarks what the LICENSE AND
    COPYRIGHT did for copyrights.  The D.pm file had the actual text, and
    the other files simply say to look at D.pm.  To summarize, the word
    MULDIS is a trademark and how you may use it has limitations.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Updated the "Muldis DB for Perl 6" implementation
    reference to say that it is now a secondary version, and that the Perl
    5 version is now the only main muldis D implementation.  Generally
    speaking, it does not help the adoption of Muldis D if we are giving
    the impression that it has a dependency that most people don't have
    and/or isn't ready for production use, namely Perl 6, and Perl 5 should
    be given more support in the meantime.

    * (Basics.pod, Ordered.pod)  Minor fixes.

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.23.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.23.0.tar.gz.

    * Reverted the only change made in release 0.22.1, by recombining the 6
    files Core(|/\w+).pod back into the single file Core.pod; it would then
    be split apart again but in a different way.  For simplicity of
    documentation, the rest of the release 0.23.0 change items are written
    from the point of view of starting with the combined Core.pod.

    * Pulled apart Core.pod to turn as much of it as possible into language
    extensions, leaving the remaining core as minimalist as possible, such
    that it contains barely more than what is needed to both bootstrap the
    Muldis D language and satisfy the mandatory parts of "The Third
    Manifesto".  The minimized core still provides the full system catalog
    complexity, but has relatively few system-defined generic data types
    and system-defined operators.  There were 9 new Ext/\w+.pod files
    created out of the reductions: Ordered.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod,
    Text.pod, Nonscalar.pod, Set.pod, Sequence.pod, Bag.pod, Rational.pod.
    Details of what each contains appear below.

    * Re-split apart Core.pod 4 ways, into itself and 3 new files, all of
    which have the same names of and correspond to the files of the same
    names that release 0.22.1 had: Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod,
    Routines.pod.  In that respect, then, release 0.23.0 actually served to
    just eliminate the 2 files Functions_(S|Nons)calar.pod, whose contents
    were either merged into Routines.pod or spread out into the 9 new Ext
    files; and some smaller portions of Types(|_Catalog).pod were also
    moved out into some of the 9 new Ext files.  Details pre-split follow.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.23.0 and Core.pod and Types.pod
    and Types_Catalog.pod and Routines.pod and Ordered.pod and Integer.pod
    and Blob.pod and Text.pod and Nonscalar.pod and Set.pod and
    Sequence.pod and Bag.pod and Rational.pod 0.20.0 and Basics.pod 0.16.0
    and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.15.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.12.0 and Temporal.pod
    0.5.3.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Ordered.pod, Core.pod, Temporal.pod)  Removed the Ordered union
    type; from now on, any type is potentialy orderable based on what
    functions exist for it, not by its type declaration.  Also removed the
    4 Spec.\w+ofOrdered types.  Any routine declarations that used Ordered
    before now use Universal instead.  Moved all sys.Core.Ordered.\w+
    functions to Ordered.pod from Core.pod, renaming them to
    sys.Ordered.Ord.\w+.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the Cat.ScalarLiteral type; from now on, the
    limitations of what values can be used for the scal_lit attribute of
    Cat.ExprNode are either dialect-defined or implementation-defined; all
    others can still be defined using the 'func' attribute.

    * (Basics.pod, Rational.pod, Core.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod,
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Demoted the Rat types from the language core into
    a language extension.  Moved all sys.Core.Rat.\w+ types (plus the
    sys.Core.Spec\w+ofRat types) and functions to Rational.pod from
    Core.pod, renaming the 'Core' to 'Rational'. Likewise moved and renamed
    the 3 rational-specific catalog types [PInt2_N, E_RM, RatRoundRule].
    Updated Basics.pod to reflect this.  Rearranged PTMD_Tiny.pod and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod to move their elements for Rat and E_RM literals to
    the end of the files, where language extension literals now go.

    * (Integer.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.Int.\w+ functions (plus
    the sys.Core.Spec\w+of(Int|UInt) types) to Integer.pod from Core.pod,
    renaming the 'Core' to 'Integer'.

    * (Blob.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.Blob.\w+ functions (plus the
    sys.Core.Spec\w+ofBlob types) to Blob.pod from Core.pod, renaming the
    'Core' to 'Blob'.  Likewise moved and renamed the blob-specific catalog
    type PInt1_4.

    * (Text.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.Text.\w+ functions (plus the
    sys.Core.Spec\w+ofText types) to Text.pod from Core.pod, renaming the
    'Core' to 'Text'.

    * (Core.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Renamed all 8
    sys.Core.(Bool|Int|Text|Blob).\w+ remaining types to
    sys.Core.Scalar.\w+.  So now all the generic core types have names in
    the just 8 main type groupings: Scalar, Tuple, Relation, their 3 Quasi
    counterparts, Universal, Remnant.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the 4 Spec.\w+ofScalar types.  So now the only
    similar such types left in the core are the 4 Spec.\w+ofBool ones;
    collapsed the mention of them under TYPE SUMMARY into a footnote.

    * (Nonscalar.pod, Core.pod)  Moved 31 (about 3/7) of the
    sys.Core.(Tuple|Relation).\w+ functions to Nonscalar.pod from Core.pod,
    renaming the 'Core' to 'Nonscalar'.  The moved were in 5 groups, the
    first being all Tuple.\w+, the remaining 4 all Relation.\w+.  Group 1
    had these 4: degree, attr_from_Tuple, Tuple_from_attr,
    substitution_in_default.  Group 2 had these 11: degree,
    is(|_not)_empty, empty, universal, power_set, negation,
    transitive_closure, (|maybe_)reduction, map.  Group 3 had these 5:
    is(|_not)_proper_subset, exclusion, composition, join_with_group. Group
    4 had these 6: (|static_)substitution(|_in_(restriction|semijoin)).
    Group 5 had these 5:
    outer_join_with_(group|maybes|defaults|product|extension).

    * (Set.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.(Set|Maybe).\w+ functions to
    Set.pod from Core.pod, renaming the 'Core' to 'Set'.

    * (Sequence.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.Seq.\w+ functions to
    Sequence.pod from Core.pod, renaming the 'Core' to 'Sequence'.

    * (Bag.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.Bag.\w+ functions to Bag.pod
    from Core.pod, renaming the 'Core' to 'Bag'.

    * Following all the above moves, there were 56 operators (53 functions,
    1 updater, 2 procedures) remaining in Core.pod; of those, the
    'Universal' namespace had 5 functions and 1 updater, the 'Bool'
    namespace had 6 functions, the 'Tuple' namespace had 10 functions, the
    'Relation' namespace had 33 functions, and the 'Control' namespace had
    2 procedures.

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.22.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.22.1.tar.gz.

    * This release takes place on a rare February 29th.

    * This release is minimalist and serves only to split up the file
    Core.pod into itself plus 5 new files, all named Core/\w+.pod:
    Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod, Functions_Scalar.pod,
    Functions_Nonscalar.pod.  This split was done mainly to make the
    information easier to maintain and to read.  Where the original file
    was 168KB, the largest of the new files is 60KB.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.22.1 and Core.pod 0.19.1 (all 5
    Core/\w+.pod started at 0.19.1 also).  The other pre-existing versioned
    files are unchanged.

2008-02-26  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.22.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.22.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.22.0 and Core.pod 0.19.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.15.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.14.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    0.11.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new "Numeric Types" pod subsection under TYPE
    SYSTEM, which outlines what features concerning numeric data are and
    are not provided by the Muldis D language core.  To summarize, the core
    numerics are all exact radix-independent "bignum", suitable for all
    magnitude of rational or floating-point numbers; no special values like
    NaNs or infinities are provided, they are left to language extensions.

    * (Core.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the rounding
    method 'to_even' to 'half_even' and added 2 more rounding methods
    'half_down' and 'to_inf'; the 2 complement 'half_up' and 'to_zero'.

    * (Core.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Enhanced the Rat
    numeric type so it now has 2 actual possreps, defined over Ints, called
    'ratio' (2 attrs) and 'float' (3 attrs), rather than having zero actual
    possreps and just a conceptual ratio one.  The 'float' possrep is
    intended to make it easier to deal with numbers in scientific notation,
    which is particularly useful for very large or very small numbers.
    Added the 4 functions Rat.Rat_from_Int_triple and
    Rat.(mantissa|radix|exponent) to reflect the 'float' possrep.  (But
    note that these such functions are deprecated for generic scalar ones.)
    In PTMD_Tiny, added a third format for specifying Rat literals, named
    'float', which looks like 'Rat:float:9:314159*10^-5'; also renamed the
    'pair' format to 'ratio'.  In HDMD_Perl_Tiny, updated the PHMD node for
    Rat literals to add some 'float' formats and rename the 'pair' formats.

2008-02-15  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.21.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.21.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.21.0 and Core.pod 0.18.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.14.1 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.13.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    0.10.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm, Basics.pod)  Updated the paradigm list of Muldis D to
    add the word "homoiconic", which I just learned about today and which
    is strongly descriptive of any "D" language, especially of Muldis D.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Renamed the 'treat' function to 'treated';
    renamed the 'v' parameter of that and the 'is_value_of_type' function
    to 'topic'.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the notes on a complete tuple|relation types'
    cardinalities to say specifically how to calculate them, rather than
    generally saying it is done using permutations.

    * (Core.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added new scalar
    catalog data type sys.Core.Cat.Comment which represents a Muldis D code
    comment that programmers can attach to various catalog elements; it is
    also useful for preserving comments translated to/from other languages.
    This type is the same as Text|Name but is disjoint from both.  Also
    added a new Comment token or PHMD node type to both Tiny dialects.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated most (11) of the tuple catalog types to add a
    'comment' attribute to each, so code comments can be attached to code
    in the most appropriate places possible, such as to individual
    expression nodes or to whole statements or to whole routines.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the 2 functions sys.Core.Relation.un(wrap|group)
    to add the new 'inner' argument, which resolves ambiguity of what
    attribute names are being added for the result when the input relation
    has no tuples (and the MST of every input relation attribute is Empty).

    * (Core.pod)  Added the 4 functions
    Relation.static_(extension|substitution(|_in_(restriction|semijoin)))
    which are all simpler-syntax versions their 'static_'-less counterparts
    where the values being added or substituted are the same for every
    tuple, so there is no need to incur a conceptual function call per
    input tuple.  So now every Muldis D function with a function parameter
    now has an alternate specialized variant which handles certain common
    cases, without a function parameter.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the function sys.Core.Tuple.multi_update as a
    short-hand for multiple update_attr; in fact it is necessary in cases
    where the latter would otherwise be used but a type constraint would
    require multiple attribute updates as a unit.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the function sys.Core.Tuple.substitution_in_default
    which should help users write less verbose Muldis D code where they can
    just specify parts of a desired tuple value and let the rest be filled
    in with default attributes for the desired tuple's type.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated specifier for called procedure name so it
    can be in both formats that a Cat.NameChain can have.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added support for
    quasi-nonscalar literals as per nonscalar literals.

2008-02-07  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.20.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.20.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.20.0 and Core.pod 0.17.2 and
    Basics.pod 0.14.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.12.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.9.0
    and SeeAlso.pod 0.3.4.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the constant
    first part of a fully-qualified name format for a Muldis D language
    variant, from 'MuldisD' to 'Muldis_D'.  This is to help not perpetuate
    the myth that the normal/correct way to spell the language name is with
    MuldisD (1 word) rather than Muldis D (2 words); I have already seen a
    number of places using that shortened form, incorrectly.  Note that the
    only reason the package name has them rammed together is because that
    is normal practice for Perl namespaces, which the spec is written
    under.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod,
    SeeAlso.pod)  Rewrote the "Representation" POD sub-section of the
    "MULDIS D" POD main section of Basics.pod, which included renaming the
    "Concrete" and "Abstract" dialect groupings to "Plain Text" and "Hosted
    Data".  Then renamed any references to said groupings in all 5 files.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Rewrote most of the DESCRIPTION
    pod in light of both the "Representation" change and MuldisD.pm's new
    VERSIONING section, to conform to them and remove redundancies.  Also
    smaller changes for the same reasons in other parts of the 2 Tiny
    files.  In HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, split the GENERAL STRUCTURE pod section
    into itself and LANGUAGE NAME, the latter portion being rewritten.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Shortened the syntax for a
    Cat.Name value, which huffmanizes the grammars more and also allows
    other improvements.  The cat_name grammar token no longer specifies a
    "Cat.Name:" prefix, and the Cat.Name phmd node is now simply a Perl Str
    rather than being a 2-element Array; any parsing context that is
    expecting a generic literal grammar token or generic phmd node will
    interpret a character string without metadata as being a Cat.Name.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated every nonscalar literal
    grammar token and phmd node to remove its element that specifies a
    predefined type name which constrains/defines the literal's heading.
    This metadata was verbosity that couldn't really be used except within
    the DBMS, wherein it already existed there in code definitions that is
    processing the literals.  As an exception to this straight-removal, for
    plain relation literals, a new replacement feature was added for the
    removed, which specifies the relation's attribute list when the
    relation has no tuples to provide that information.  Given that this
    attribute list is formatted differently than a tuple list, just one of
    those things appears in a relation literal, and a parser can easily
    distinguish between them.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Fleshed out or fixed the
    syntaxes for specifying Cat.NameChain literals.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added the syntax to call procedures, thus making a
    PTMD_Tiny code file actually able to represent a Muldis D 'main'
    routine, and hence actually represent a program; which is simply a
    sequence of procedure calls following a language name declaration.  The
    literal-defining syntax which still makes up most of the grammar is now
    specifically for defining arguments for the procedure calls

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.19.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.19.1.tar.gz.

    * This release is very minimalist, serving to rename a few files, and
    do as little as possible otherwise.  It seemed best to do all actual
    file content changes separately, so that it is easy to do
    same-file-name diffs on consecutive distro versions and see what
    content changed.

    * Renamed Grammar.pod to Dialect/PTMD_Tiny.pod, and PerlHosted.pod to
    Dialect/HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod.  Correspondingly renamed the pseudo-package
    names (what the NAME pod says) in those files.  Then updated all the
    other distro files to refer to the 2 renamed by their new names.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.19.1 and Core.pod 0.17.1 and
    Basics.pod 0.13.1 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.11.1 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.8.1
    and Hierarchical.pod 0.0.3.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

2008-02-03  Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.19.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.19.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.19.0 and Core.pod 0.17.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.13.0 and Grammar.pod 0.11.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.8.0 and
    Hierarchical.pod and Conventions.pod 0.0.2.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm)  Added new main pod section VERSIONING which explains
    the fully-qualified name formats of Muldis D variants in a generic
    manner, so to help make the Muldis D code more future-proof.  Updated
    the related DESCRIPTION paragraph.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Renamed the 2 operators is(|_not)_equal to
    is(|_not)_identical, which is arguably less ambiguous on what they are
    testing for.  Also renamed their parameters from v(1|2) to
    (topic|other); the parameters are still commutative, though.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the 2 operators is_(increase|decrease_or_same) to
    is(|_not)_before, and eliminated the 2 operators
    is_(decrease|increase_or_same); considering that all Muldis D
    parameters are named rather than ordered, the eliminated operators are
    completely redundant with invoking the 2 kept ones with the arguments
    swapped, and order-specific variants are not helpful.  Also renamed
    their parameters as per the is_identical change.  This elimination also
    brings more parity with other parts of the language that considered
    only-position-swapped variants useless, such as the presence of
    is_subset but no is_superset.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Eliminated the Cat.Order
    type, which currently doesn't seem to be that useful after all (if this
    judgement was wrong, it could be brought back later).  Eliminated the
    corresponding grammar token and PHMD node kind.  Eliminated the 2
    Ordered.(|reverse_)comparison functions.  Eliminated the 4
    Cat.Order_\w+ functions.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Renamed the Just type to
    Single (and QuasiJust to QuasiSingle); while breaking from the
    Haskell-inspired triple, it reads better for Muldis D, and is more
    descriptive.

    * (Core.pod)  Added 3 functions sys.Core.Maybe.(nothing|single|attr)
    where the first 2 will select a Nothing or Single value respectively,
    and the last one will extract the payload of a known-Just value.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the 2 functions Int.(in|de)crease to
    Int.(in|de)crement.

    * (Core.pod)  Added an initial complement of 5 relational functions to
    do half-outer natural joins in different ways,
    Relation.outer_join_with_(group|maybes|defaults|product|extension);
    also added inner join variant of the first, Relation.join_with_group.
    The 2 'group' functions are intended as convenient tools for gathering
    both parent and child records from a database using a single query
    while avoiding duplication of the parent record values.

    * (Core.pod, Hierarchical.pod, Conventions.pod)  Other minor updates.

2008-01-25   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.18.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.18.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.18.0 and Core.pod 0.16.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.12.0 and Grammar.pod 0.10.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.7.0 and
    Hierarchical.pod and Conventions.pod 0.0.1.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated TYPE SYSTEM to remove the requirement where
    every value must have exactly one most-specific-type / MST, which is
    supposed to exist in a generic "D" language to assist some kinds of
    polymorphism.  Although that restriction is still generally followed
    for all system-defined types, and it would ideally be the case for all
    user-defined types, the design of Muldis D does not generally require a
    value to have a single MST in order to work, and moreover to enforce
    the single-MST requirement would place an undue burden on users, who
    would typically need to define many gratuitous types to satisfy it.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the "Tuple Types and Relation Types" subsection
    of TYPE SYSTEM to directly explain that any 2 zero-tuple relation
    values of the same degree and with the same attribute names are
    considered identical, regardless of the declared types of those
    attributes in the code that produced them; every attribute of a
    zero-tuple relation value has an MST of Empty, which is a subtype of
    every other type.  A consequence is that every Set|Maybe or Seq or Bag
    type's single zero-tuple value is identical to every other's one.

    * (Core.pod)  Further echoing the design of Haskell's "Maybe" feature,
    added 2 complementary subtypes of Maybe named
    sys.Core.Relation.(Nothing|Just), which have exactly zero tuples or 1
    tuple, respectively; the Nothing type has exactly 1 value of Maybe, and
    the Just type has all the rest of them.  Nothing is Muldis D's answer
    to the SQL NULL, in that it is meant as a marker that a value is
    unknown or inapplicable; but unlike SQL, Nothing is an actual value,
    and it does equal itself.  Just is the same container, that always does
    hold exactly one value.  Also added the 2 subtypes Quasi(Nothing|Just).

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Took the explicit grammar token or
    PHMD node type specific to the Maybe type, and replaced it with two
    that are specific to the Nothing or Just types, where each
    more-specialized replacement has simpler syntax than what it replaced.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Rounded out /
    added better symmetry to the type system by adding the concept of a
    quasi-scalar type and adding the system-defined QuasiScalar maximal
    type.  Since there are no normal system-defined quasi-scalar types from
    which that new maximal would draw a default value (all normal
    quasi-scalar types are expected to be user-defined, if they exist at
    all), also added the QuasiScalar.E_D subtype which exists soley for
    that purpose.  Also added the system-defined Remnant maximal type, and
    that already had the pre-existing ScaTupRel normal system-defined type
    from which to draw a default value.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the ExprNode|ProcStmtArg attribute 'tk' and
    InnerFunc attribute 'result_tk', due to seemingly not being too useful.

    * (Core.pod)  Added constraint to trees of expression nodes or inner
    routines such that any node which is the sole tree root in its context
    must have the empty string as its name.  These 4 catalog data types now
    have that constraint added: ExprTree, Inner(Func|Updater|Proc)Tree.
    Removed the no-longer-needed 'root_\w+' attribute from each of these 4
    catalog data types: InnerFunc, Func, Updater, Proc.  Some small fixes.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the 2 functions Ordered.is_(in|de)crease_or_same,
    which are to is_(in|de)crease what '>='|'<=' are to '>'|'<'.  With this
    addition, all 6 of the common dyadic compare operators [=,!=,<,>,<=,>=]
    are directly represented, so no need to emulate over several functions.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the 3 functions Relation.disjoint_(insertion|union)
    and Set.disjoint_insertion; they are the same as the non-disjoint
    versions but that they fail if there are duplicate tuples|elements
    rather than succeeding as a full or partial no-op.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod, Hierarchical.pod, Conventions.pod)  Other
    minor updates.

2008-01-12   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.17.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.17.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.17.0 and Core.pod 0.15.0 and
    Grammar.pod 0.9.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.6.0.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.  Added 2 new files
    lib/Language/MuldisD/Hierarchical.pod and
    lib/Language/MuldisD/Conventions.pod, each of which start at version
    0.0.0.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the Cat.InnerFunc type to add a couple missing
    attributes, result_tk and result_type.

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Removed the explicit grammar tokens or
    PHMD node types that were specific to these 7 Muldis D types: UInt,
    PInt, URat, PRat, NEBlob, NEText, Database.  So now just these 14 ones
    are directly supported: Bool, Int, Rat, Blob, Text, Tuple, Relation,
    Set, Maybe, Seq, Bag, Cat.Name, Cat.NameChain, Cat.Order.  This change
    was made to remove unnecessary complexity from the grammar/PHMD specs;
    now for the most part there is now only 1 distinct grammar token or
    PHMD node type for each core Muldis D root type (so the removed are
    covered by their remaining parents); non-root types generally only have
    their own when they also have a syntactic short-hand to take advantage
    of.  Any otherwise orphaned examples were updated to the parent syntax.
    Also removed the 'index' variant of Seq from Grammar, leaving just the
    ordered variant, which was all PerlHosted had anyway.  And updated the
    'count' variant of Bag to do itself what it had used a PInt token/node
    to do.

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Upgraded the specification formats for
    rationals so that now any rational value can be directly selected, not
    just those whose denominators are powers of 2..36; for example, you can
    now select the rational 1/43 directly where you couldn't before.  To
    facilitate this, there are now 2 formats you can define a rational in,
    the previous 'N.N' format, called 'radix', and the new 'N/N' format,
    called 'pair'; in PerlHosted, the latter is given as 2 elements, not 1.

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Added grammar tokens and PHMD node
    types for all the not yet covered enumerated scalar catalog types:
    Cat.E_RM, Cat.E_TK, Cat.E_TDM, Cat.E_ENK, Cat.E_PSAK.  So that fills in
    all the remaining gaps in those files and it is now possible to either
    directly select any Muldis D value or directly define the system
    catalog entries of any Muldis D code that would.

    * (Hierarchical.pod)  This new file has begun to outline an additional
    official dialect of Muldis D, which is terse and intended for normal
    use for writing code in, or writing code examples in, unlike the
    'catalog' dialect which is damningly verbose for normal use.

    * (Conventions.pod)  This new file is a style guide, and mainly starts
    off with suggesting good ways to name entities.

    * (Core.pod)  Other minor updates.

2008-01-05   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.16.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.16.0.tar.gz.

    * This release coincides with the 5th anniversary of the first CPAN
    release of the first Muldis D / Muldis DB progenitor; DBIx::Portable
    version 0.01 was released on 2003 January 5th.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.16.0 and Core.pod 0.14.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.11.0 and Grammar.pod 0.8.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.5.0.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files have their version numbers all
    incremented by 0.0.1.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Renamed the routine kinds update_operator and
    inner_update_operator to the shorter 'updater' and 'inner_updater',
    though the terms 'update operator' and 'updater' will continue to be
    interchangeable.  Also renamed 6 corresponding catalog types to
    UpdStmt, MultiUpdStmt, InnerUpdater, InnerUpdaterSet, InnerUpdaterTree,
    Updater, and renamed any referencing attributes as appropriate.

    * (Core.pod)  Reformatted all the routine signatures to look more
    natural for Muldis D, rather than being mostly identical to the Perl 6
    routine signature format.  The format for function declarations is now
    "function foo result Bar params { baz(Quux) }" rather than "foo of Bar
    (Quux $baz)", and the format for updater or procedure declarations is
    now "updater|procedure foo update { fi(Fum) } read { baz(Quux) }"
    rather than "foo (UPD: Fum $fi ; RO: Quux $baz)".  Note that this
    version may not be final, and another reformat may likely come, though
    that one would likely just consist of different keywords to replace
    [result, params, update, read] and not other changes; feedback on this
    is welcome.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the 3 core pseudo-types
    sys.Core.Some.(Universal|ScaTupRel|Ordered), and added the 1 core
    remnant type sys.Core.Remnant.ScaTupRel; the new one replaces one of
    the removed, and the other 2 removed are now just redundant with the
    normal Universal and Ordered types.  It seemed rather arbitrary that
    some contexts (like routine signatures) which couldn't actually take
    all combinations of their parameter types would in some cases have said
    parameters documented as pseudo-types, other times as regular types.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Reversing one change made
    for release 0.9.0, a Cat.Name is once again allowed to be the empty
    string (like 'Text', not 'NEText'), and Cat.NameChain parts likewise.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Officially demoted the Order
    type from a generic type to a catalog-specific type, since it isn't
    really ever expected to be used in user data, but just routine
    definitions.  It was renamed from sys.Core.Order.Order to
    sys.Core.Cat.Order, and the definition of the type was moved from the
    generic scalars section to the catalog scalars section; it did not get
    further renamed to 'E_FOO' as Order is still more special than the
    average enum type as per the enum type Bool, if nothing else than for
    directly corresponding to a concept in multiple other programming
    languages such as Perl 6.  In Core.pod, added new main pod section
    SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE CATALOG FUNCTIONS and moved the Order routines
    there, renaming each of them from Order.foo to Cat.Order_foo in the
    process.  In Grammar.pod, renamed the 'order' token to 'cat_order' and
    moved it next to the existing catalog types; made other appropriate
    updates there, and updates and moves in PerlHosted.pod.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated any routine signatures that specified some
    collection-type parameters as Foo{Bar} so they spell it FooAsBar
    instead.  Also added a few explicitly system-defined Spec.FooOfBar that
    didn't previously exist but were referred to by said routines.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the 3 scalar types Spec.PInt(1_4|2_(N|36)) to
    Cat.PInt(1_4|2_(N|36)), moved to catalog types.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed (from 'Spec') or added the following 9
    quasi-catalog incomplete types, which are used only as the declared
    types of some system-defined N-adic relational operators; all are in th
    new package 'sys.Core.QuasiCat': (Set|Bag)Of(Tuple|Relation), SetOfBag,
    MaybeOfTuple, SeqOfSeq, QuasiSetOf(Tuple|Relation).  Moved to a new doc
    section SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE QUASI-CATALOG PARAMETERIZED TYPES.

    * (Core.pod)  With the above 2 groups removed from 'Spec', that package
    is now simply for conveniently system-defined collection-of-scalar
    types that are likely to be used in user data, and many of which are
    the declared types of N-adic system-defined scalar operators.  Added
    any of the following 32 subtypes that didn't previously exist:
    sys.Core.Spec.(Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag)Of(Scalar|Ordered),
    sys.Core.Spec.(Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag)Of(Bool|Int|UInt|Rat|Blob|Text).

    * Brought the TODO file in line with recent progress, replacing the few
    broad-scope line items with more detail-scope ones, added some
    speculation items.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2008.

    * (Core.pod)  Other minor updates.

2007-12-31   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.15.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.15.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.15.0 and Core.pod 0.13.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.10.3.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the type sys.Core.Int.PInt2_N to
    sys.Core.Spec.PInt2_N and moved its declaration downwards.

    * (Core.pod)  Generally speaking, Muldis D now requires that for any
    defined relation type, there is a corresponding (same heading) tuple
    type also defined; the reverse is not true, though.  To be specific,
    any relation type is defined over the type that its tuples must be; a
    tuple type definition covers the minimal required relational heading.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the 6 tuple type factories
    (|Quasi)(Set|Seq|Bag)Elem, which have the same headings as the 6
    existing relation type factories (|Quasi)(Set|Seq|Bag).

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed Cat.(|SetOf)NameMap to Cat.(|SetOf)NameExprMap,
    and renamed its attributes from 'key','value' to 'name','expr'.  Also,
    as a reversal of one change made for release 0.8.0, renamed
    Cat.BiDiNameMap to Cat.AttrRenameMap, and renamed its attributes from
    'key','value' to 'before','after'.  The latter is therefore no longer a
    subtype of (the first of) the former.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the catalog types so that they can now fully
    define expression trees and functions (except where new data types are
    also required).  Renamed the enumerated type Cat.E_EK to Cat.E_ENK.
    Renamed the tuple type Cat.Expr to Cat.ExprNode, and added a 9th 'tk'
    attribute to it.  Added 6 new tuple|relation catalog types Cat.ExprSet,
    Cat.ExprTree, Cat.InnerFunc, Cat.InnerFuncSet, Cat.InnerFuncTree,
    Cat.Func.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the catalog types so that they can now fully
    define multi-update statements and multi-update operators (as per
    above).  Building on the expr/func stuff, added 6 new tuple|relation
    catalog types Cat.UpdateStmt, Cat.MultiUpdateStmt, Cat.InnerUpdateOper,
    Cat.InnerUpdateOperSet, Cat.InnerUpdateOperTree, Cat.UpdateOper.  Also
    added 2 more values to the Cat.E_ENK type, '(upd|ro)_param', and then
    generalized Cat.Expr so it can be used with subject-to-update
    params/args to define pseudo|virtual-variables.  So the composition of
    an update operator definition is mostly expression nodes like with the
    composition of functions.  Note that presumably the Muldis D provision
    of updateable virtual relvars (aka SQL's "views") would be provided as
    an abstraction over functions and update operators, or some such.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the catalog types so that they can now fully
    define non-atomic statements and procedures (as per above).  Building
    on the expr/func/upd stuff, added 1 new scalar catalog type Cat.E_PSAK
    and 7 new tuple|relation catalog types Cat.ProcStmtArg,
    Cat.ProcStmtArgSet, ProcStmt, Cat.SeqOfProcStmt, InnerProc,
    Cat.InnerProcTree, Cat.Proc.

    * (Core.pod)  Added 8 generic reduction operators
    'sys.Core.(Relation|Set|Seq|Bag).(|maybe_)reduction', so users can more
    easily write their own N-adic reduction operators.

    * (Core.pod)  Added initial complement of 11 Seq-specific functions,
    besides the 2 aforementioned: 'value', 'update_value', 'insertion',
    'deletion', 'is_element', 'is_not_element', 'catenation', 'repeat',
    'reverse', 'is_subseq', 'is_not_subseq'.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Other minor updates.

2007-12-18   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.14.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.14.0.tar.gz.

    * This release coincides with the 20th birthday of Perl; Larry Wall
    released Perl 1 to the public on 1987 December 18th.  Moreover, on this
    20th birthday is the general/stable release of Perl 5.10, its best yet.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.14.0 and Core.pod 0.12.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.10.2 and Grammar.pod 0.7.2 and PerlHosted.pod 0.4.2.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Small updates to the ROUTINES main section.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Added 4 new trivial data
    type definitions 'sys.Core.(|Quasi)(Tuple|Relation).D0', some of which
    were previously referenced but not defined; also corrected any
    references that said 'D0C(0|1)' to just say'D0'.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new pseudo-type sys.Core.Some.ScaTupRel, which is
    essentially a union type over Scalar|Tuple|Relation; it is for tersely
    refering to the general type of a scalar|tuple|relation attribute.

    * (Core.pod)  Added 3 new Int functions, 'increase' and 'decrease'
    (meaning '++' and '--'), and 'factorial'.

    * (Core.pod)  Added 2 new Tuple functions 'attr_from_Tuple' and
    'Tuple_from_attr', which work with degree-one tuples; they are
    analogous to the 2 "(T|R) from (R|T)" Relation functions that work with
    cardinality-one relations.  Also added 2 new Tuple functions 'attr' and
    'update_attr', which read or write an attribute in an arbitrary tuple.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new Relation function 'power_set', which results in
    a Set of all subsets of its Relation argument (which could itself be
    just a Set).  (Note: Not sure whether or not this is actually useful.)

    * (Core.pod)  Added descriptions to the Relation functions
    group|ungroup, updated those of tuple wrap|unwrap.  Added 3 new
    complementary tuple|relation functions cmpl_wrap|cmpl_group.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the Relation function 'substitution', and
    added 2 new relational functions,
    'substitution_in_(restriction|semijoin)'.  While 'substitution' will
    transform all tuples unconditionally, the 2 new 'in' functions let one
    keep the substitutions within a subset of the tuples.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new Relation function 'map', which provides a
    convenient one-place generalization of per-tuple transformations that
    otherwise might require the chaining of up to a half-dozen other
    operators like restriction, extension, and rename; like Perl's "map",
    or SQL's generic select-list.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the Relation function 'summary', giving it a
    full parameter list and description.  Note that this function is only
    intended to be used in situations where the corresponding SQL would
    involve a GROUP BY, and there is to be one result tuple per group,
    which also means an empty result relation from an empty input relation.
    Those who want their summary to be one tuple for the entire input, even
    an empty one, would just invoke the N-adic / aggregate operators
    directly without doing it by way of 'summary'.

    * (Core.pod)  Added 2 new Relation functions 'is_(|not_)proper_subset'.

    * (Core.pod)  Added initial complement of 6 Set-specific functions:
    'is_member', 'is_not_member', 'insertion', 'deletion', 'Set_from_wrap',
    'Set_from_attr'.  The first 4 are just short-hands for their Relation
    counterparts, having tuple attribute values as parameters rather than
    whole tuples.  The 'Set_from_attr' is intended to be the most
    convenient way to pull out values from an attribute for feeding to an
    aggregate function; it is short-hand for simple relational operations.
    The 'Set_from_wrap' ought to be convenient for other reasons, or if not
    then its counterparts under Bag or Seq perhaps will be.

    * (Core.pod)  Added initial complement of 2 Maybe-specific functions:
    'attr_or_default', 'attr_or_value'.  They are intended to be like
    Perl's defined-or functions, resulting in their only/main argument's
    content if it isn't empty, or a default value / second argument if it
    is; alternately these are like SQL's 2-argument COALESCE or NVL or
    IF_NULL etc; these should be useful in defining outer-joins.

    * (Core.pod)  Added initial complement of 17 Bag-specific functions:
    'is_member', 'is_not_member', 'insertion', 'deletion', 'Bag_from_wrap',
    'Bag_from_attr', 'cardinality', 'is_subset', 'is_not_subset',
    'is_proper_subset', 'is_not_proper_subset', 'union', 'intersection',
    'difference', 'count', 'Set_from_Bag', 'Bag_from_Set'.  The first 6 are
    as per the 6 set-specific functions.  The next 8 are as per the
    same-named Relation functions but that they have special semantics that
    take > 1 multiplicity of values into account; the Relation ones work as
    is for Set, but not as typically desired for Bag.  Then 'count' says
    how many occurrances (which may be zero) of a value are in a Bag.  The
    last 2 are short-hands for moving data between Set and Bag types.

    * (Core.pod)  Other minor updates.

2007-12-09   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.13.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.13.0.tar.gz.

    * As of this release, the in-code $VERSION declarations of all Perl 5
    packages in this distribution are changed to match the X.Y.Z format
    that the same packages' own VERSION POD had all along (the old in-code
    format was X.00Y00Z).  A consequence of this change is that this
    distribution has gained an external dependency on the Perl 5 module
    'version', which is not bundled with Perl 5.8.x; however, it *is*
    bundled with Perl 5.10.x, so if you are using that newer Perl, you
    won't have to install 'version' separately from CPAN.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.13.0 and Core.pod 0.11.0.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed some tuple|relation functions so they describe
    the function's result rather than its action, or are otherwise more
    improved; that is, they are less verbs and more nouns or adjectives:
    'exists' => 'is_member', 'insert' => 'insertion', 'delete' =>
    'deletion', 'evacuate' => 'empty', 'project' => 'projection', 'remove'
    => 'cmpl_projection', 'tclose' => 'transitive_closure', 'restrict' =>
    'restriction', 'extend' => 'extension', 'summarize' => 'summary',
    'substitute' => 'substitution', 'compose' => 'composition'.  Also
    renamed the enumerated value Cat.E_TDM:restrict to
    Cat.E_TDM:restriction.  Also added 2 new complementary functions
    sys.Core.Relation.(is_not_member|cmpl_restriction), and added
    sys.Core.Relation.universal to go with sys.Core.Relation.empty.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed some blob|text functions: 'catenate' =>
    'catenation', 'fold_case_to_(upper|lower)' =>
    'case_folded_to_(upper|lower)', 'trim_whitespace' =>
    'whitespace_trimmed'.  Also renamed some ordered functions:
    '(|reverse_)compare' => '(|reverse_)comparison'.

2007-11-23   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.12.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.12.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.12.0 and Basics.pod 0.10.1 and
    Core.pod 0.10.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new core functions Ordered.is_(in|out)side_range,
    which provide generic range checking for any Ordered subtype.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the 2 functions (Blob|Text).contains each to
    .is_substr, and renamed Relation.contains to .is_subset; also added 3
    new functions that are 'is_not' variants of the first 3.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new enumerated type Cat.E_RM (rounding
    method), and then merged the 5 old specialized functions
    Rat.round_(half_up|to_(even|floor|ceiling|zero)) into the 1 new generic
    function Rat.Int_from_Rat, whose second parameter is of the new type;
    also renamed Rat.rebase to Rat.round.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new ternary tuple type Cat.RatRoundRule which
    defines a controlled coercion of a real number into a rational number
    having a specific radix and precision.  (Also added new type
    Int.PInt2_N, an integer > 1, which supports it.)  Then refactored the 4
    functions Rat.(round|log|natural_(power|log)) to have 1 parameter of
    the new tuple type rather than 3 round-guiding parameters.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Small typo fixes.

2007-11-19   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.11.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.11.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.11.0 and Basics.pod 0.10.0.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated multiple sections to indicate express support
    for multi-threading within Muldis D virtual machines, where the
    transaction trees of the in-DBMS processes are mutually autonomous, but
    synchronized by the DBMS when they use the same depots.  Updated
    sections were mainly ENVIRONMENT, and TRANSACTIONS AND CONCURRENCY, and
    RESOURCE MODULARITY AND PERSISTENCE, and ENTITY NAMES.  The top level
    entity namespace 'fed' is now specifically the depot mounts by a single
    in-DBMS process, not all depot mounts in the whole DBMS.

2007-11-08   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.10.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.10.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.10.0 and Core.pod 0.9.2 and
    Basics.pod 0.9.0 and Grammar.pod 0.7.1 and PerlHosted.pod 0.4.1.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm)  Updated the DESCRIPTION to mention Muldis D in
    retrospect having some designs in common with FoxPro or xBase.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added a TERMINOLOGY item for "universal" to specify
    that Muldis D does not allow sets to be members of themselves, and more
    generally that no type or value definitions may be recursive; so
    "universal" is only the common superset of sets that these rules allow;
    some philosophers may say that it is possible for sets to have
    themselves as members, so this update specifies that Muldis D does not.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the 'main' routine kind to specify that it can
    not see or update any global variables, which now leaves
    '(|inner_)procedure' as the only kind that can; also that 'main' should
    just be loading/invoking depots, where all other user-defined code is.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new RESOURCE MODULARITY AND PERSISTENCE main
    section.  Removed the whole concept of user-defined entities being
    allowed to exist outside of depots; now all user-defined entities must
    exist in depots.  Also, the conceptual role of depots has been expanded
    to cover general user code libraries, and are not mainly just for data.
    Also, all user-defined relvars|types|invokable-routines now live in
    packages, rather than users having the choice for them to be in or out;
    but package members can also be public, so no actual choice is lost.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated ENTITY NAMES; removed the 'app' top namespace.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated ENTITY NAMES to add the 'imp' top level
    namespace, which is like 'sys' in purpose but that while 'sys' is just
    for types and routines that are defined by the standard Muldis D
    specification, 'imp' is for other, non-standard types and routines that
    a Muldis D implementation has added, and which are specific to that
    implementation.  Also added is the new relcon namespace 'cat.impl',
    which is to 'imp' what 'cat.system' is to 'sys'.  It is expected that
    the catalog relvars under cat.(mount|foreign|interp), whose structures
    were already expected to be implementation-specific, would likely need
    to be defined in terms of (typically named nonscalar) data types that
    are also implementation-specific, and so those are invokable under
    'imp'.  Besides that main intended purpose of 'imp', a Muldis D
    implementation that wants to embrace and extend Muldis D with further
    types and routines intended for user data, should declare them there.

    * (Basics.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Updated ENTITY NAMES, and
    other references, to rename the 'glo' (global) top-level entity
    namespace to 'fed' (federation), for better accuracy; likewise, renamed
    the 'sch' (schema) top-level namespace to 'sdp' (subdepot).

    * (Basics.pod)  Fleshed out ENTITY NAMES with new documentation
    subsections that describe the various name spaces, and interpretation.

    * (Core.pod)  Added comment to Relation.Set mentioning that a set type
    is essentially the power set of the type of its 'value' attribute.

2007-10-11   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.9.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.9.1.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm and Core.pod 0.9.1.  The other
    pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Core.pod)  Each main type declaration now had its own level-2
    heading rather than it being a bullet-list item.

    * Fleshed out the tail of this Changes file with a summary pre-release
    (rel. 2007 June) history of Muldis D; going from mid-2002 to mid-2007.

2007-10-09   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.9.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.9.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm and Core.pod 0.9.0 and Basics.pod
    0.8.0 and Grammar.pod 0.7.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.4.0.  The other
    pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Added a paragraph to the
    DESCRIPTION of MuldisD.pm that gives the fully-qualified name of the
    official/original (not embraced and extended) Muldis D language spec
    that this distro represents, and gives instructions for people to
    change at least its authority portion of the name if they release their
    own modifications to the language spec, and instructs for Muldis D code
    to embed the long name of the spec they are written to.  In Grammar.pod
    and PerlHosted.pod, updated their formats for specifying the language
    long name they conform to; in both cases, the root token or PHMD node
    is now a simple sequence of these 4 parts: 'MuldisD', the authority
    string, the version number, and the payload; PerlHosted.pod also gives
    an alternative 3 parts version for up-front VM config, rather than
    repeating it with every payload later.

    * (Basics.pod)  Overhauled what kinds of Muldis D routines there are,
    and consequences thereof; the largest updates were to the ROUTINES
    section.  A hierarchical diagram was added to ROUTINES to group the
    kinds by similarity.  The 3 kinds function|update_operator|procedure
    gained inner_\w+ counterparts, which are the same but soley live within
    and comprise the definitions of other routines, while the initial 3 are
    now strictly not so.  All kinds of constraint routines are now pure
    deterministic functions (that don't see globals), like just the
    type_constraint used to be, which is fine since entire databases are
    defined as being types or variables (so now only procedure|main can see
    globals).  The distinct state_constraint is now gone, merged into
    type_constraint, each of which is tied to a data type definition and
    runs at value selection time.  Now, a transition_constraint is tied to
    a variable and runs when it is updated, it has 2 arguments holding the
    before|after state.  Updated ENTITY NAMES to split the 'lex' namespace
    into itself and 'inn', the latter being used to invoke inner routines,
    and the former being just for true lexicals.  Also updated TRANSACTIONS
    AND CONCURRENCY.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  In Core.pod, added a new SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE
    PROCEDURES section, and its first 2 entries,
    sys.Core.Control.(fail|try_catch), the use of which is now how you
    generally do explicit transactions; appropriate parts of Basics.pod
    were updated to mention/explain this.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the operator sys.Core.Relation.not to
    sys.Core.Relation.negation, for better symmetry with other set ops.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the TYPE SYSTEM section to add a new main type
    category called "remnant types", which is composed of all types that
    don't qualify as a type of the previous 5 categories.  Generally
    speaking, a remnant type is the declared type of each attribute of a
    quasi-nonscalar type, when said attribute isn't one of the special
    system-defined maximal types.  Also added the concepts of "exclusion"
    types and "negation" types to complement the 3 existing concepts of
    union|intersection|difference types.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Renamed the catalog data
    types 'Cat.ShortName' and 'Cat.LongName' to 'Cat.Name' and
    'Cat.NameChain' respectively, and updated their definitions; a Cat.Name
    must now be a non-empty string, Cat.NameChain parts must be likewise,
    and updated the escaping rules for the latter.  In Core.pod, updated
    their documentation, and added 2 more types 'Cat.NESeqOfName' and
    'Cat.FlattenedNameChain' which now are part of the definition of
    'Cat.NameChain'.  In Grammar.pod, updated the grammar concerning entity
    names so they are treated differently than text data; also added
    examples of both to EXAMPLES.  In PerlHosted.pod, added for the first
    time definitions of Cat.Name and Cat.NameChain PHMD nodes, as the new
    section CATALOG SCALAR VALUES; also, "type name" portions of older PHMD
    nodes now can take both payload formats of Cat.NameChain nodes.  Also
    in Core.pod, renamed any other types having 'ShortName' to remove the
    'Short'.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new catalog data type Cat.Type plus new supporting
    types: Cat.E_TK, Cat.E_TDM, Cat.NameTypeMap, Cat.SetOfSetOfName,
    Cat.SetOfNameChain.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new data type 'Cat.Exception' which holds the
    details of a thrown exception, but it lacks a description for now.

    * (Basics.pod)  Removed the CATALOGS main section, and the "Temp Old
    Entity Names Docs" subsection of ENTITY NAMES; these texts were very
    out of date and will be replaced later.

2007-09-23   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.8.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.8.1.tar.gz.

    * From now on, the file version of MuldisD.pm will be kept in sync with
    the distribution version, regardless of whether that file had otherwise
    been changed since the previous release.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm and Core.pod 0.8.1 and Grammar.pod
    0.6.1 and PerlHosted.pod 0.3.1.  The other pre-existing versioned files
    are unchanged.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Made various minor
    documentation bug-fixes or updates.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE SCALAR FUNCTIONS sections
    for enumerated types to consolidate the per-value selector function
    documentation for brevity; the functions themselves were unchanged.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated all the system-defined function signatures to
    remove the 'RO:' text by parameters; that text was superfluous because
    all parameters of all functions are always read-only.  The 'UPD:' and
    'RO:' text in system-defined procedure signatures remains, since a
    procedure can have either/both subject-to-update or read-only params.

2007-09-22   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.8.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.8.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: Core.pod 0.8.0 and Basics.pod 0.7.0 and
    Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod 0.5.1 and MuldisD.pm 0.5.0 and SeeAlso.pod
    0.3.2 and PerlHosted.pod 0.3.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files
    are unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm, Basics.pod)  Updates to various main/introductory
    documentation.  Changed the NAME of Basics.pod to "10,000 Mile View of
    Muldis D" from "Design document of the Muldis D language" as it isn't
    the intro file anymore (MuldisD.pm is instead).  Moved the large
    PREFACE and DESCRIPTION sections from Basics.pod to MuldisD.pm, then
    did a small amount of editing to them; Basics.pod then gained small
    replacements.  Further minor edits to other sections.

    * (Core.pod, PerlHosted.pod, Temporal.pod, Spatial.pod)  More
    system-defined package consolidation: Empty merged into Universal;
    Database merged into Tuple; (Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag) merged into Relation;
    Quasi(Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag) merged into QuasiRelation.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added indenting to the ENTITY NAMES hierarchy.

    * (Core.pod)  Moved the documentation sections about non-catalog
    specialized subtypes below their counterpart sections on catalog types.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the data types Cat.(ShortNameSet|AttrRenameMap)
    to Cat.(SetOfShortName|BiDiShortNameMap); the latter's attributes were
    also renamed.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the set of catalog data types by adding these
    new ones: Cat.ScalarLiteral, Cat.E_EK, Cat.Expr, Cat.ShortNameMap,
    Cat.SetOfShortNameMap.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Reflected that Muldis DB is now LGPL rather than GPL.

2007-09-11   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.7.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.7.0.tar.gz.

    * Removed the file Catalog.pod, after moving its main content into the
    files Basics.pod and Core.pod, and removed any references to
    Catalog.pod in other files.  The CATALOGS documentation section was
    moved into Basics.pod, below ENTITY NAMES.  The TYPE SUMMARY section
    was merged into its counterpart in Core.pod.  The 2 SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE
    CATALOG (|NON-)SCALAR DATA TYPES sections were moved into Core.pod, at
    the end of all the type definitions.

    * New file versions are: Core.pod 0.7.0 and Basics.pod and Grammar.pod
    0.6.0 and Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod 0.5.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.2.0.
    The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Chopped the 'main' routine kind down so that it is now
    only applicable to a non-hosted Muldis D application; hosted (eg, by
    Perl) Muldis D programs don't have 'main' Muldis D routines.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Changed the database type so its attributes
    may now be composed of not only relations, but databases (the leaves of
    this recursion are all relations); the reason for this was to provide a
    more elegant way to represent the common convention of dividing a
    relational database into schemas for better entity management.

    * (Basics.pod)  Started rewrite of the ENTITY NAMES documentation; for
    now there is just the addition of a new namespace hierarchy.  The new
    hierarchy has the following 8 top-level names: cat, sys, app, glo, dep,
    sch, pkg, lex.  The old namespaces map to the new ones as follows:
    sys.cat -> cat.system ; nat.cat -> cat.native ; mnt -> cat.mount ;
    foreign -> cat.foreign ; interp -> cat.interp ; sys.(type|rtn).* ->
    sys.(Core|<extension>).<package>.* ; nat.(data|type|rtn).* ->
    (app|glo.<depot>).* ; lex.* -> lex.* .  The top-level names [dep, sch,
    pkg] are context-sensitive aliases for something under 'app' and/or
    'glo', so entities can tersely and portably refer to their own
    depot|schema|package, sort of like 'lex' (lexical) allows.  Notably,
    the type of entity, data|type|rtn, is no longer included in the long
    name of most entities, and entities of different types now clearly
    share the same namespace, as per is typical with SQL DBMSs where both
    tables and stored procedures are in the same schema object namespaces.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod, Temporal.pod, Spatial.pod)
    Renamed all the system-defined types and operators to roughly fit into
    the new namespace hierarchy.  The operators saw less drastic changes,
    as roughly speaking, their 'rtn' name component was simply changed to
    'Core' (it would have been different for temporal/spatial operators,
    but none of those were defined yet).  The types saw more drastic
    changes; roughly speaking, all 'type' were renamed to one of
    Core|Temporal|Spatial, and for non-catalog core types, the unique part
    of each name was replaced with 2 instances of itself.  Roughly
    speaking, what used to be a type name now doubles as a type name and a
    package name for both that type and for its operators.  Following this,
    the new system-defined packages were then either consolidated or split
    as appropriate, grouping most similar entities and separating less
    similar ones.  For example, all generic 'Int' types were grouped under
    one package, and the 'Temporal' types were split into several.

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Updated the example user-defined
    entity names so that they roughly fit into the new namespace hierarchy.
    What was nat.type.* is now glo.the_db.*.

2007-09-03   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.6.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.6.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: Core.pod 0.6.0 and Basics.pod 0.5.1 and
    Grammar.pod 0.5.0 and Temporal.pod 0.4.1 and Spatial.pod 0.4.0 and
    Catalog.pod 0.3.1 and PerlHosted.pod 0.1.0.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Core.pod, Basics.pod, Catalog.pod, Temporal.pod, Spatial.pod)
    Renamed the union type Ordinal to Ordered, and any types previously
    referred to as being ordinal types are now referred to as being ordered
    types.  This change makes things more correct (and less confusing),
    since actual ordinal types are supposed to be both finite and discrete,
    whereas some Muldis D ordered types are infinite and/or continuous.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the floating-point numeric types from the core
    again, but that they aren't yet re-added to some language extension;
    they will be later, as per inexact or significant-figure-watching
    numerics in general.  Now the core just contains exact numerics that
    are integers or rationals (and generally speaking it will now be said
    exact types specifically which some common language extensions like
    temporals or spatials are generally built over).  This simplifying
    change was made because it is expected that most general uses of
    numerics in Muldis D program code will not use numbers in the extreme
    ranges that only inexact floats can represent efficiently (eg, 10^308),
    and rather they will likely just have numbers of less than 20-30
    digits, which are easy enough for rationals.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the Rat|BRat|DRat type definitions slightly.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the URat|PRat types, which are to Rat what
    UInt|PInt are to Int.  Also added (Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag)OfRat types.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new Int operators range|median|mode, updated the
    Int operator 'power', moved the definition of 'abs' upward.

    * (Core.pod)  Added an initial complement of 28 Rat operators, which
    are mostly a superset of analogies to the Int operators (minus
    'remainder'); additions include operators for calculating
    means/averages, logarithms, and rounding.

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Added sections for the Rat|URat|PRat
    types as per for Int|UInt|PInt.

    * (Spatial.pod)  Added an initial hierarchy of 15 spatial types, but
    as yet they lack descriptions.

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.5.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.5.0.tar.gz.

    * The rational numeric and floating-point numeric data types have been
    promoted to the language core, and so the main content of Num.pod was
    moved into Core.pod, under the TYPE SUMMARY and SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE
    SCALAR DATA TYPES sections; the rest of the file Num.pod was then
    deleted, and any references to it in other files were removed.  The
    promoted data types were also renamed to remove the '.Num'.

    * New file versions are: Basics.pod and Core.pod 0.5.0 and Grammar.pod
    0.4.1.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Reorganized the entity namespace 'lex.*' so it no
    longer mirrors the structure of the (global) 'nat.*' namespace.  There
    are no longer any lexically scoped data types or routines or special
    catalog variables; only normal variables can be lexical.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the definition of the 'function' routine kind
    so it has no lexical variables, consists of a single expression tree,
    and can only invoke functions; hence a function is now just a named
    expression tree.  Replaced the 'host_gate' routine type with the 'main'
    routine type, as it is conceptually the non-invokable "main program" of
    a Muldis D program.

    * (Core.pod)  Added a bunch of named core data subtypes that exist for
    convenience, such as because they name many core operator parameter
    types.  Added a tree of these to the TYPE SUMMARY section, and added a
    new SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE SPECIALIZED SUBTYPES section.  For example,
    many of these additions are named
    'sys.type.(Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag)Of(Bool|Int|Blob|Text)'.  The pre-existing
    'sys.type.PInt2_36' type was also moved into these sections.

    * (Core.pod)  Rearranged the documentation sections for operators, so
    that they are all grouped first by routine kind and second by the
    mainly applicable data type, rather than the reverse grouping; all
    functions appear first (the vast majority), then all update operators
    (a minority), then all system services (a smaller minority.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed many 'v' function parameters to 'topic'.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the 2 int-text mapping function signatures to
    rename any 'Text' to 'NEText'.  Merged and generalized the 4 blob-text
    mapping functions into 2 which lack '_(2|16)' suffixes.  Added
    'maybe_*' variants of the 2 functions 'Int.(quotient|remainder)'.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the 'Rat' subtype 'RatI' and renamed its sibling
    subtypes to '(B|D)Rat' from 'Rat(B|D)'.

    * (Core.pod)  Replaced the 2 'FloatB(32|64)' data types with the more
    generic 'Float' type, then gave that 2 new subtypes of '(B|D)Float' as
    per the 'Rat' type hierarchy.  The new 'Float' type is an exact numeric
    of unlimited precision as per 'Int' and 'Rat', and it doesn't have any
    special values like a +/- zero distinction, nor infinities, nor NaNs.
    Note that all Muldis D core numeric types are exact and lack special
    values; any numerics that are inexact or have special values will be
    relegated to language extensions; in the core, any precision loss that
    could possibly happen in an operation (eg, from a square-root) is part
    of the defintion of operators, not the data type.

    * (Core.pod)  Replaced the function 'Tuple.extend' with
    'Tuple.product'; the latter is also fleshed out.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the definitions of these functions:
    'Relation.quotient' (also renamed from 'divide'), 'Relation.restrict',
    'Relation.extend'.  Also added these functions: 'Relation.product'.

    * (Grammar.pod)  Changed the tokens 'Cat(Short|Long)Name' to
    'Cat.(Short|Long)Name' so they match actual type names like the rest of
    Grammar.pod does.

2007-08-12   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.4.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.4.1.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: PerlHosted.pod 0.0.1.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (PerlHosted.pod)  This release is an experiment with an alternate
    formatting of the POD list items, in an attempt to make them look more
    like actual lists under the Search CPAN site, rather than paragraphs;
    each "=item Foo" is now spelled "=item *\rFoo".

2007-08-09   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.4.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.4.0.tar.gz.

    * Renamed MuldisD.pod to MuldisD.pm, and added an empty dummy package
    declaration of Language::MuldisD to it, all for the sole purpose of
    helping the CPAN indexer link to this distribution properly; it doesn't
    work when the namespace file is plain pod.  For similar reasons, the
    version number of MuldisD.pm will now always be kept in sync with the
    whole-distribution version number declared in the Makefile.PL.

    * Also renamed Language.pod to Basics.pod.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm and Basics.pod and Core.pod and
    Grammar.pod and Num.pod and Temporal.pod 0.4.0.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Introduced complete vs parameterized types.

    * (Basics.pod)  Every data type is now named and is referred to by that
    name, the change being that only scalar types used to have names.  This
    said, the actual identities of types haven't changed, so 2
    differently-named declarations of types that aren't scalar and have the
    same structure will still be considered to be the same actual type; the
    names for types that aren't scalars are simply aliases for this
    identity.  This change was made to greatly simplify (and reduce errors
    in) the process of declaring data types, particularly hierarchical
    types, and declaring nonscalar values.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new operators
    Universal.(is_value_of_type|treat|default).

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed each of the operators Universal.(equal|not_equal)
    and Relation.(empty|not_empty) to prepend an "is_".

    * (Core.pod, Num.pod, Temporal.pod)  Updated each of the ordinal data
    types to specify what their minimum and maximum values are, or whether
    said are infinities.

    * (Core.pod)  Redefined the Maybe-returning N-adic functions
    Ordinal.(min|max) with versions that instead try to return that
    functions' identity value when given zero argument values, and
    fails/dies in just specific situations where said identity is
    impossibly or impractically large to handle.  Also added 2 new
    functions Ordinal.maybe_(min|max) that provide the old behaviour.

    * (Core.pod)  Redefined the N-adic functions Blob.(and|or|xor) from
    resulting in Maybes to resulting in identity values on zero inputs.
    Also corrected the Relation.intersection function definition such that
    its identity value is actually the universal relation for its heading,
    not the empty relation; depending how big that is, the function may now
    possibly fail on zero input values.  Also added new function
    Relation.not, which results in its argument subtracted from the
    universal relation for the same heading; this may possibly fail if that
    is too big a value.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Restricted the Temporal.Duration(|OfDays) types to be
    specific to data with time zone offsets, and added 2 more types
    Temporal.Duration(|OfDays)NoTZ to handle the other possibility; the
    idea is that the former should be considered more accurate than the
    latter, as per DateTime vs DateTimeNoTZ.  Also updated all 4 to permit
    negative durations in addition to positive ones.  Also rearranged the
    types to group all the with-timezone and no-timezone together.

    * (Grammar.pod)  Rewrote the representative Concrete Muldis D grammar
    so that it is formatted as an actual compiling (though otherwise
    untested) Perl 6 grammar, rather than the pseudo-LALR grammar.  Also,
    the rewritten grammar is actually complete, unlike the many "todo" gaps
    in the old.  Not that it won't stand to be further improved later.

    * (Grammar.pod)  Added new EXAMPLES documentation section which shows
    actual Concrete Muldis D code fragments.

    * Added new file lib/Language/MuldisD/PerlHosted.pod, which starts at
    version 0.0.0.  This file parallels Grammar.pod, but instead shows what
    arrangement of core Perl data structures make up Perl hosted Abstract
    Muldis D, which is the recommended interchange format between Muldis D
    implementations and Perl applications.  With code examples!  This file
    also stands as a recommendation for a general AST for use by database
    related modules, such as ORMs, to specify database queries with.

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.3.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.3.1.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: Language.pod and SeeAlso.pod 0.3.1.  The other
    versioned files are unchanged at 0.3.0.

    * Fixed a bug where both MuldisD.pod and Language.pod had the same
    NAME, which resulted in CPAN indexing problems.

    * Minor fix in SeeAlso.pod.

2007-07-24   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.3.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.3.0.tar.gz.

    * What was Muldis-DB at version 0.2.0 and earlier, has been split in 2,
    with the parts to be Language-MuldisD and Muldis-DB, each at version
    0.3.0 and later.  Prior to the split, both the Perl 5 and Perl 6
    versions of Muldis-DB contained identical copies of what became
    Language-MuldisD; after the split, neither Muldis-D had a copy.

    * All versioned files had their version numbers brought up to 0.3.0.

    * This is the first release of the Language-MuldisD distribution, and
    the first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 modules named
    Language::MuldisD::\w+.

    * The file lib/Language/MuldisD.pod is cloned from part of what used to
    be lib/Muldis/DB.pm, and the file lib/Language/MuldisD/SeeAlso.pod is
    cloned from part of what used to be lib/Muldis/DB/SeeAlso.pod, and
    lib/Language/MuldisD/Language.pod was renamed from
    lib/Muldis/DB/Language.pod, and all other lib/Language/MuldisD/\w+ were
    renamed from lib/Muldis/DB/Language/\w+.

    * Updated Grammar.pod concerning '(Int|Blob):x:y' so that the 'x' is
    now a single character in the same base as the 'y', rather than being a
    possibly multi-character integer in base-10; moreover, the 'x' is now
    equal to the highest value that a character may represent, which in the
    base in question is 1 less than the base number.  So eg, base-2 is now
    specified with an 'x' value of '1', base-10 is a '9', base-16 an 'F',
    etc.  Also, the 'y' part for Int|Blob is no longer quote-delimited.

    * This is the Language-MuldisD-0.3.0 file manifest:

2007-07-20   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.2.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.2.0.tar.gz.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the portions of it that became part of the Language-MuldisD
    distribution following release 0.2.0.

    * New file versions are: DB.pod and Language.pod and Core.pod and
    Catalog.pod and Grammar.pod and SeeAlso.pod 0.2.0.  Unchanged file
    versions are: Num.pod and Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod 0.1.0.

    * Updated the TRANSACTIONS AND CONCURRENCY section of Language.pod in
    regards to how the scope of explicit transactions is specified, and
    where implicit transactions occur.  Also, Muldis D now no longer has
    language for non-scope-attached transactions, and any concept of
    distinct transaction initiation or termination statements will be
    hoisted to the host language (presumably as methods of ::DBMS objects).

    * Updated Core.pod to add the scalar type 'PInt2_36', and to replace
    the pseudo-type 'Any' with the pseudo-type 'Some.Universal', and added
    'Some.Ordinal'.

    * Updated Grammar.pod concerning integer literals; they can be
    represented with any of base-2 thru base-36 now.

    * Updated Grammar.pod and Core.pod concerning enumerated types, such as
    Bool and Order; individual values are now specified using eg
    [Bool:true] rather than [Bool.True], which then makes them more like
    literals of other simple types, and less like data type names.

    * Updated Core.pod to add definitions for the generic operators common
    to all ordinal types: compare, reverse_compare, is_increase,
    is_decrease, min, max.  Added 'reverse' operator for the Order type.
    Added or replaced a bunch of operators for the Int|Blob|Text types.
    Other small changes.

    * Updated Core.pod to add an initial complement of common tuple and
    relation operators (such as project, join, union), perhaps most of
    them.  These are a large part of what makes Muldis D a relational
    language at all.

    * Updated Catalog.pod to add new core data types: Cat.ShortNameSet,
    Cat.AttrRenameMap.

2007-07-11   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.1.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.1.0.tar.gz.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the portions of it that became part of the Language-MuldisD
    distribution following release 0.2.0.

    * This is a major release that focuses on overhauling or defining part
    of the Muldis D meta-model / system catalog, which is essential for
    supporting any user-defined DBMS entities, that is, for doing anything
    remotely useful.  Said overhaul is expected to be staged over 3-4
    consecutive releases, of which the current one is essentially just
    updating documentation; not much code was changed by this release.

    * As of this release, all pod-only files now also have version numbers,
    shown in the VERSION docs by NAME, like code-containing modules do; the
    initial version numbers are all 0.1.0.

    * Muldis D now has 2 representation formats (Concrete Muldis D,
    Abstract Muldis D) rather than 3 (relations, ASTs, strings).

    * Rearranged any relevant docs so that the most important core scalar
    types are now in the order [Bool, Int, Blob, Text] and the relation
    type factory Maybe now appears after Set.

    * Muldis D now has a new scalar data type, "Order", which is an
    enumeration (like "Bool" is) of 3 values: [Increase, Same, Decrease];
    it is the result type of any dyadic comparison operator that underlies
    the likes of less|greater-than or min|max or sorting operations.

    * Muldis D now has the new scalar types "Cat.ShortName" and
    "Cat.LongName", which replace the also removed "Cat.EntityName" and its
    (as yet unused) system-defined subtypes.

    * Split up Language.pod 6 ways, into itself and
    Language/(Core|Catalog).pod and
    Language/Ext/(Num|Temporal|Spatial).pod.  For the most part, the only
    initial content of the 5 new files are corresponding portions of what
    used to be the SYSTEM-DEFINED DATA TYPES and (actually empty)
    SYSTEM-DEFINED ROUTINES main documentation sections of Language.pod,
    but that the CATALOGS main section was also moved to Catalog.pod;
    Language.pod retained all the other documentation sections that it
    previously had.  (Language.pod retained about 75% of its previous
    content; about 25% was moved out.)

    * Further updated the 5 language files with type definitions, to update
    some definitions, and also to add a small TYPE SUMMARY main doc section
    to each file.

    * Updated Core.pod to add several main doc sections that have an
    initial complement of system-defined routines.  In particular, the
    equal|not_equal|assign routines that all types have are now defined,
    and all the common boolean and integer operators were added, and some
    converter routines such as int-from-text et al, were all added.  Many
    other operator definitions are pending, especially the relational ones.

    * Added new file lib/Muldis/DB/Language/Grammar.pod, which describes
    Concrete Muldis D details that aren't applicable to Abstract Muldis D.

2007-06-29   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.0.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.1.tar.gz.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the portions of it that became part of the Language-MuldisD
    distribution following release 0.2.0.

    * New file versions (not marked though) are: Language.pod 0.0.1.

    * The primary purpose of this release is to re-license the Muldis D
    specification under actual free software licenses, specifically version
    3 of the GPL family of licenses, which the Free Software Foundation
    formally published on 2007 June 29th.  By contrast, the previous Muldis
    D releases were under an expiring proprietary license, with just the
    promise of a free re-license to come.  Accordingly, the file
    LICENSE/GPL was added to this distro, which contains the text of the
    GPL version 3.0.

    * This release also includes a collection of small documentation
    updates and fixes, such as the following:  We now use the official
    typography for the names 'TTM' and 'D' and such.  Added a DOCUMENTATION
    READING ORDER section to the README file.

2007-06-20   Darren Duncan <darren@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.0.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.0.tar.gz.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the portions of it that became part of the Language-MuldisD
    distribution following release 0.2.0.

    * Initial file versions (not marked though) are: Language.pod 0.0.0.

    * As of this release, the Muldis D specification is officially in
    pre-alpha development status.  A lot of documentation is present, but a
    lot isn't.  What is mostly done is the higher level documentation.
    What is mostly undone is documentation of the API details.  What is
    already present should be sufficient to begin study of Muldis D such
    that it can actually be put to use within the next few weeks or months
    as Muldis D is fleshed out.  Also, it should be possible now to start
    writing code that implements it or uses said.

2006-09-15 thru 2007-06-02

    * Started rewriting Rosetta again, but with a name change, since
    "Rosetta" was no longer appropriate for various reasons.  This rewrite
    took the intentionally bad and temporary name QDRDBMS, to be renamed
    again (to Muldis DB) later on.  With the name change allowed for the
    previous version numbering of Rosetta to be dropped, and this rewrite
    would eventually be first released as version zero.

    * QDRDBMS was started in the wake of having had a lot more experience
    in reading up on the truly relational model of data, and was now
    designed fundamentally to be the design and implementation of a new
    turing complete programming language for working with relational
    databases, now called "QDRDBMS D".

    * Made an experimental CPAN release of QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 on
    2007-05-31, which specifically was a quick branch that stripped out all
    the code and just contained the documentation.  This was the only CPAN
    release of the (partial) project under the QDRDBMS name.

    * Shortly after this, QDRDBMS was renamed to its presumably final name
    of "Muldis DB", and its command language to "Muldis D".  But while
    "Muldis D" stuck, "Muldis DB" was fated for a further rename later.

2006-04-14 thru 2006-11-22

    * Started a complementary Perl 6 project named "Relation" which was
    intended to provide native tuple and relation data types for ordinary
    use in Perl 6 programs like other built-in collection types.  It is
    now stagnant; it will likely get un-stuck after Muldis Rosetta sets an
    example for it.

2006-02-01 thru 2006-04-13

    * The first simultaneous releases of the Perl 5 and 6 versions of
    Rosetta's rewrite occurred on 2006-02-01; they were also the first CPAN
    releases of either version.  The Perl 6 one was Pugs release 6.2.11
    (SVN rev 8934).

    * On 2006-02-23 was the first (Perl 5) CPAN release of Rosetta where
    the project was then officially an implementation of "The Third
    Manifesto", the central work of Darwen and Date's DBMS proposal;
    moreover, Rosetta's command language was named "Rosetta D", to be a "D"
    language by the terms of said proposal.

    * On 2006-03-20 was the (Perl 5) release that declared Rosetta was to
    be fundamentally a self-contained relational DBMS (and the core
    distribution would bundle such an implementation of its API) rather
    than "just" a DBMS wrapper; though extensions could still chose to
    operate as wrappers over other DBMSs.

    * On 2006-04-13 was the last CPAN release of the Perl 5 Rosetta, and
    Pugs 6.2.12 (SVN rev 10930), on 2006-06-26, had the corresponding Perl
    6 version; Pugs 6.2.13 (SVN rev 11402), on 2006-10-27, had the last
    CPAN release of Perl 6 Rosetta, with trivial Perl 6 only updates.
    After this, Pugs would have a Muldis Rosetta instead.

2005-12-06 thru 2006-01-31

    * Rosetta started to evolve so that its API and design was based on
    relational algebra, which is a lot of smaller generic constructs that
    can easily be arranged into queries; this is in contrast to the
    previous design based around monolithic and unwieldy SQL "select"
    queries.  Generally speaking, there was increasing influence on the
    design by Hugh Darwen's and Chris Date's proposals on how a truly
    relational DBMS should work.  This time period also saw very little
    code, and almost entirely documentation updates.

2005-12-05

    * Darren Duncan is introduced by David Wheeler to the truly relational
    model of data, in a posting on the Bricolage development list in the
    "Re: [6977] New branch for maintenance of Bricolage 1.10.x." thread.

    * David said that Darren's expressed thought, that compound data types
    in table fields was a violation of first normal form, was in fact a
    misconception about the relational model.  David then referenced a
    recent interview with C. J. Date.

    * This set off a chain of events which was the largest paradigm shift
    to ever affect the Rosetta project.  While the continuing goal of
    Rosetta remained largely the same, the way this was to be accomplished
    would become quite different, and the project would gain a new goal, to
    help improve the design of relational DBMSs themselves.

2005-09-30 thru 2005-12-04

    * Started a full rewrite of Rosetta, with the intent of avoiding being
    over-engineered, and cutting corners in the short term so to get
    something useable at all sooner.  The idea was to focus on vertical
    development first, so that at least a subset of features work earlier,
    taking the development strategy of Perl6-Pugs itself as an example;
    this is in contrast to the more horizontal development strategy of the
    first Rosetta implementation.

    * Moreover, this rewrite was being done simultaneously in both Perl 5
    and Perl 6; each language had its own independent but synchronized
    version, with the Perl 6 one intended to be the main future one that
    guided design decisions, and the Perl 5 one intended to be the one
    production-ready first, to be used until Perl 6 itself was production
    ready.  That co-development was maintained afterwards, and happens with
    the Muldis Rosetta core.

    * Developed and released on CPAN the Rosetta DBMS framework, whose
    intended purpose was to provide rigorous portability of database
    schemas and database-using applications between different SQL DBMS
    products.  A lot of design documentation was produced, as well as some
    code and tests, but while a significant amount of executing code was
    produced, no solution emerged that was actually useable for real work;
    what did get produced was also unnecessarily complicated.

    * The very first CPAN release of anything related to Rosetta was on
    2003-01-05, in the form of DBIx::Portable version 0.01, as
    DBIx-Portable-0.01.tar.gz.

    * A Lightning Talk was also given introducing Rosetta at OSCON 2005;
    but it is Muldis Rosetta instead that will fulfill the promises made in
    it.

2002-06-07

    * Started writing self-contained code components that were explicitly
    designed to enable external code that used them to work seamlessly on
    multiple database products.  Some of this work was reused later in the
    Rosetta DBMS framework et al, and hence 2002 is the start of the
    declared copyright date range for Muldis D language specification.
