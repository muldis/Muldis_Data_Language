    * Muldis::D version 0.32.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.32.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.32.0 and Sequence.pod 0.25.0 and
    Routines.pod 0.24.1 and Basics.pod 0.22.1.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod, Routines.pod)  Fixed a few typos.

    * (Sequence.pod)  Removed 'last_index' as it seems to be less useful
    than previously thought; it isn't really a short-hand for 'cardinality'
    since to make it work also with empty sequences, it would need to
    result in a Maybe or be wrapped in tests.

    * Muldis::D version 0.31.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.31.0.tar.gz.

    * Split apart Nonscalar.pod 2 ways into Tuple.pod and Relation.pod; the
    first file got the 4 "sys.std.Nonscalar.Tuple.\w+" named functions
    (grouped in 1 pod section), and the second file got all the remaining,
    27 "sys.std.Nonscalar.Relation.\w+" named functions (grouped in 4 pod
    sections); following the split, the functions were renamed to
    "sys.std.Tuple.\w+" and "sys.std.Relation.\w+", respectively.  Any
    references to these in other files [D.pm, Core.pod, the README file]
    were updated accordingly.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.31.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.27.0 and
    Rational.pod 0.25.0 and Types.pod and Routines.pod and Sequence.pod
    0.24.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod and Ordered.pod and Tuple.pod and Relation.pod
    0.23.0 and Basics.pod 0.22.0 and Core.pod 0.21.1 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    0.20.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod, Types.pod)  Fixed a few fossils.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Renamed the main pod sections "TYPES FOR
    DEFINING ENTITY NAMES AND COMMENTS" and "SIMPLE GENERIC CATALOG
    COLLECTION TYPES" to "SIMPLE GENERIC (|NON)SCALAR TYPES", respectively.

    * (Routines.pod)  Added new "SYSTEM-DEFINED GENERIC SCALAR-CONCERNING
    FUNCTIONS" main pod section, along with a complete complement of
    generic scalar possrep attribute extraction and updating functions.
    These 7 "sys.std.Core.Scalar.\w+" functions were added, which take
    advantage of the fact that a scalar possrep looks just like a tuple:
    '(|update_)attr', 'multi_update', '(|cmpl_)projection',
    'Tuple_from_Scalar', 'Scalar_from_Tuple'.

    * (Rational.pod)  Removed the now-redundant (with 'Scalar.\w+') 7
    rational numeric specific value selection and possrep attribute
    extraction functions: 'Rat_from_Int_(pair|triple)', 'numerator',
    'denominator', 'mantissa', 'radix', 'exponent'.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new "Ordered Types" pod section under the TYPE
    SYSTEM main section.  It outlines the system-defined support for
    order-sensitive operators and related best practices.  Values of any
    type can be explicitly sorted, but only scalar root types can have a
    default sorting function defined for them.  Currently, only functions
    for total ordering have privileged support, but partial ordering
    functions can be user-defined over such.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new routine kind "order_determination" in the
    ROUTINES main section, so that the concept of a "system-compatible
    fundamental order-determination function" can now be referred to by a
    terse name in the rest of the documentation.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  In a reversal
    of one aspect of release 0.19.0, brought back the then-removed
    Cat.Order enumerated scalar type, but enhanced to have 2 possreps
    rather than none (one over 'Name', one over 'Int'); also brought back
    the literal syntax specific to this type in both Tiny dialects, but
    sans any 'Cat.' prefix; also both dialects now provide for direct
    analogies to both possreps.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod)  Updated the 'Cat.InnerScalarType'
    type to add a 7th attribute named 'order' which defines an optional
    type-default total ordering function, which can only be defined with a
    root type.  Added generic scalar function 'sys.std.Core.Scalar.order'
    which externalizes this function, and it is what other order-sensitive
    operators can wrap when dealing with values of such scalar types.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Rational.pod)  Updated the
    descriptions of the 10 types [Bool, Int, Blob, Text, Cat.Name,
    Cat.NameChain, Cat.DeclNameChain, Cat.Comment, Cat.Order, Rat] to
    explicitly declare that each one has a type-default ordering algorithm,
    and to describe what that algorithm is.  Also stated that the
    RatRoundMeth type does *not* have a default ordering.  (Still TODO is
    to address the temporal and spatial types in one of these manners.)

    * (Ordered.pod)  Updated all of this language extension's
    "order_determination"-wrapping functions to have the 2 extra parameters
    "func" and "assuming", so that they can be customized as to what
    fundamental function they wrap, whether one defined with the comparand
    types or otherwise.  Also added the function
    'sys.std.Ordered.reverse_order'.  Also, 'min' and 'max' no longer
    result in an identity value with zero topic elements.

    * (Relation.pod)  Added new main pod section "SYSTEM-DEFINED RELATIONAL
    RANKING AND QUOTA FUNCTIONS" with an initial complement of the 2
    "sys.std.Relation.(rank|limit)" generic relational operators.  The
    "rank" function will extend the topic relation with an integer column
    with the tuples ranked 0..N, that order determined by an
    "order_determination"-function argument that it wraps; its
    functionality is essentially SQL's "RANK" but the ordering is only
    total, so no dense / not dense distinction.  This "rank" function
    provides the basis of both arbitrary quota queries as well as making
    lists sorted.  The "limit" function provides a specific kind of quota
    query, in doing a restriction on the topic relation to a consecutive
    range of tuples ranked as per "rank"; its functionality is like SQL's
    "ORDER BY" plus "LIMIT" but the result is not a sequence.

    * (Sequence.pod)  Added the 2
    "sys.std.Sequence.(|limit_of_)Seq_from_wrap" functions, which are
    essentially the same as the above rank|limit but that the result is a
    sequence rather than a generic relation.  Prefer the sequence versions
    when immediately returning the sorted query results, versus prefer the
    rank|limit versions when using their results as a subquery in a larger
    relational query.  Also added "Seq_from_attr", which together with
    "Seq_from_wrap" are analogies to similar Set and Bag functions.  Also
    added the 2 functions "last_index" and "slice".

    * (Routines.pod)  Removed the empty main pod section "SYSTEM-DEFINED
    CORE CATALOG FUNCTIONS"; catalog-specific routines will instead go in a
    new Core/Routines_Catalog.pod file when they come to be.

    * Muldis::D version 0.30.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.30.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.30.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.26.0 and
    Integer.pod and Blob.pod and Rational.pod 0.24.0 and Types.pod 0.23.1
    and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.22.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.19.0 and
    Conventions.pod 0.2.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)  Fixed a few fossils.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Refactored the catalog types for defining outer
    data types.  The oft-repeated attribute triple
    "inner_(sca|non_sca|dom)_types" was factored out into the new tuple
    (database) type Cat.InnerTypeSet, and a single "inner_types" attribute
    of that type is now used in the outer routine and type defining types
    rather than the triple.  The 3 "Cat.(Scalar|Nonscalar|Domain)Type"
    types were combined into the 1 "Cat.Type" type; now an outer type must
    have at least 1 inner type, which defines the outer type, and that
    inner type has the empty string for its name; this arrangement is akin
    to an expression node hierarchy.  Along with that, the 9
    "Cat.(Sys|Dep|Pkg)(Sca|NonSca|Dom)TypeSet" types were combined into the
    3 "Cat.(Sys|Dep|Pkg)TypeSet" types, and the corresponding 3 attributes
    in each of "Cat.(System|Depot|Package)" were consolidated into 1
    attribute for each.

    * (Rational.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the
    rational extension enumerated type "E_RM"/"Cat.E_RM" to just
    "RatRoundMeth", and also updated its literal syntax in both Tiny
    dialects likewise.

    * (Rational.pod)  Updated the "RatRoundMeth" type so that it explicitly
    has a possrep that wraps the Cat.Name type, rather than implicitly
    having no possreps.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Abbreviated the literal syntax
    for scalar catalog types in both Tiny dialects so that the literals no
    longer have a leading "Cat."; this affects the 4 types: Name,
    NameChain, DeclNameChain, Comment; but with Name it only affects the
    documentation since its literals had no 'Name' prefix to begin with.

    * (Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Rational.pod)  Updated the documentation so
    that any types declared by these files which were referred to with a
    "Cat." prefix now aren't; the affected types were "RatRoundRule" and
    several "PInt\d\w+".

    * (Conventions.pod)  Removed the suggestion about enumerated types
    being named like E_FOO; for one thing, no system-defined enums do that
    anymore; also that format may be too terse for general practice.

2008-05-11  Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.29.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.29.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.29.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.25.0 and
    Types.pod and Routines.pod and Integer.pod and Blob.pod and Text.pod
    and Set.pod and Sequence.pod and Bag.pod and Rational.pod 0.23.0 and
    Nonscalar.pod 0.22.0 and Basics.pod and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.21.0 and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.18.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new "User Namespace Correspondence" pod section
    under ENTITY NAMES.  It says how the namespaces *.lib and *.data
    inter-relate, for example when they need to have corresponding sections
    and when they need to have non-conflicting ones.  Also, when a depot
    has no subdepots or packages, then its "dep.data" is "just a database".

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new "Referencing Data Types" pod section under
    ENTITY NAMES.  It specifies a couple new language features, the first
    of which lets you directly reference types that were baked into the
    external interfaces of other entities like variables or routines, as if
    they were normal explicitly declared types; also you can simply take
    the corresponding tuple type for a relation type or vice-versa; the
    second feature is that you can tersely declare simple collection types
    inline, such as sets or sequences of Foo, saving the language and users
    from a proliferation of explicitly declared simple (|quasi-)nonscalar
    types like C<MaybeOfInt> or C<SeqOfText>.

    * (Types.pod)  Removed the 6 explicitly declared tuple type factories
    "(|Quasi)(Set|Seq|Bag)Elem", which are now superfluous as you should
    now be able to use the "tuple_from" syntax on the
    "(|Quasi)(Set|Seq|Bag)" type factories instead, if you need them.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod,
    Rational.pod)  Removed the 38 explicitly declared 'Of' types which are
    now superfluous: 24
    "(Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag)Of(Bool|Int|UInt|Blob|Text|Rat)", 4
    "(Set|Bag)Of(Tuple|Relation)", SetOfBag, MaybeOfTuple, SeqOfSeq, 2
    "QuasiSetOf(Tuple|Relation)", SeqOfProcStmt, 4
    "SetOf(Name|NameExprMap|SetOfName|NameChain)".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod,
    Nonscalar.pod, Set.pod, Sequence.pod, Bag.pod, Rational.pod)  Updated
    all references to the aforementioned deleted 'Of' types, in type
    attributes and routine signatures, to refer to the implicitly generated
    '_of' versions instead.  In Types_Catalog.pod, this also means that the
    whole SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE QUASI-CATALOG PARAMETERIZED TYPES pod section
    was eliminated.

    * (Types.pod)  Updated descriptions of the Database and Single types.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the 4
    "Cat.(System|Federation|Depot|Package)" types to ensure that they
    actually are "Database" types and not "just Tuple" types, since each
    "cat" variable is supposed to be a valid "database".  The only change
    for each of the 4 types was to convert type of its "comment" attribute
    from "Cat.Comment" (a scalar) to "single_of.Cat.Comment" (a relation);
    the latter type was also added under the misc collection types section.
    Also clarified that the "Cat.ExprNodeSet" type qualifies as a db type.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the 4 "Cat.Sys(Nsp|Func|Upd|Proc)Set"
    types to flesh out the definition of their 'parent' attributes (which
    had been left 'TODO'), and expanded the description of the "namespaces"
    attribute of the "Cat.System" type.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Refactored
    the catalog types for defining data types.  Previously, there was just
    the single C<Cat.Type> main type, plus 2 supporting enumerated types,
    that handled all of special types, root scalar and nonscalar types,
    domain types and union etc types.  Now C<Cat.Type> has been replaced
    with mainly these 9 types: Cat.(|Inner)(Scalar|Nonscalar|Domain)Type,
    Cat.Possrep(|Map)Set, Cat.KeySet; they handle all of the aforementioned
    but for special types.  There are 3 main type definition methods for
    user-defined types, each of which is represented by an outer/inner
    pair; the inners do all the work and outers are just wrappers for those
    to make them explicit depot etc entities; multiple inners can be in an
    outer, all but one playing support to the one, and inner types also can
    be embedded in outer routines.  With Cat.Type gone, the 2 enumerated
    types Cat.E_TK and Cat.E_TDM were no longer useful and were eliminated;
    along with their types, the special literal syntax for Cat.E_TK and
    Cat.E_TDM was eliminated from the 2 Tiny dialects.  Added the 9
    Cat.(Sys|Dep|Pkg)(Sca|NonSca|Dom)TypeSet types and updated the
    Cat.(System|Depot|Package) types to each have 3 corresponding
    attributes, rather than each having a placeholder 'types' attribute.
    Added the 3 Cat.Inner(Sca|NonSca|Dom)TypeSet types and updated the
    Cat.(Func|Upd|Proc)Body types to each have 3 corresponding attributes,
    rather than each having a placeholder 'inner_types' attribute; the 3
    new outer type types each have the 3 corresponding attributes also.
    Also added the 2 Cat.Sys(Spec|ScaNPR)TypeSet types and updated the
    Sys.System type to have 2 corresponding attributes; these list the
    special system-defined types of the kinds that users can't make.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added 2 catalog types for defining dbvars, both
    of the catalog and user data variety: Cat.DbVar, Cat.SysCatSet. Updated
    the catalog types Cat.(System|Depot|Package) to have a 'catalog' or
    'data' attribute each rather than a placeholder.  With this, all the
    explicit TODO placeholders in Types_Catalog.pod are now gone.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  The placeholder catalog type Cat.Exception was
    not addressed yet, and for now has been removed; it will come back
    later; so the whole OLD TYPE DEFINITIONS TO REWRITE OR REPLACE pod
    section was eliminated.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  The statement terminator semicolon no longer exists;
    it was never needed to help parsing and its presence would probably
    have confused people.  Also added whitespace allowance between main
    parts of rational literals.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added DESCRIPTION paragraph to point out that the
    PTMD_Tiny dialect is designed for a single-pass parser or lexer, and so
    it should be possible to parse such code simply and with little RAM;
    also a paragraph about the flexibility programmers have for writing
    code in the dialect, such as matters of whitespace.

    * Muldis::D version 0.28.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.28.1.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.28.1 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.24.2 and
    Types.pod and Routines.pod and Ordered.pod and Integer.pod and Blob.pod
    and Text.pod and Set.pod and Sequence.pod and Bag.pod and Rational.pod
    0.22.1 and Nonscalar.pod 0.21.1 and Basics.pod 0.20.2 and PTMD_Tiny.pod
    0.20.1 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.17.1 and Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod
    0.7.1.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * Completed the system entity renaming that began in release 0.27.0,
    such that all fully-qualified references to types and routines in the
    'sys.[A-Z]\w+' namespace have been renamed into the 'sys.std.[A-Z]\w+'
    namespace.  This was the only change made for release 0.28.1.  To be
    specific, the usage of 'sys.std' was already official in 0.27.0, and it
    was just that most documentation was out of date until now.

2008-05-01  Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.28.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.28.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.28.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.24.1 and
    Basics.pod 0.20.1 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.20.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    0.17.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Seq literals now use square brackets as list
    delimiters rather than curly braces like most literals.  It was decided
    to standardize on using square brackets to delimit the few lists where
    the order of elements in the literal is significant, while leaving the
    curly braces for the majority lists where the order is not significant.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  All the separator and list delimiter tokens (that
    are outside character string literals) now allow whitespace around
    them, which can help you wrap long lines.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Character string literals may now be divided into
    1..N consecutive character string literal segments which are separated
    by the (whitespace delimited) segment stitching character '~' (tilde);
    this can help you wrap long character strings into multiple lines.
    Likewise, blob literals can now be segmented using the same token.  Now
    we could have tried likewise with numeric literals too, but decided not
    for simplicity, as the odds of that being used are next to none.  Also
    the flat formats for name chains can not be segmented; if you have one
    that long, then use the sequence format for name chains instead.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added another format for generic
    relation literals that is more compact than the other main form due to
    only stating attribute names once rather than repeating them per tuple;
    the trade-off is that attribute values per tuple and their names are
    now mapped by ordinal position in the literal so attribute order is not
    immaterial; mutual order of whole tuples still is immaterial though.

    * (Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Fixed a few fossils.

2008-04-27  Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.27.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.27.0.tar.gz.

    * Removed the very incomplete file Hierarchical.pod, as it has become
    more superfluous given the other Tiny dialects becoming more terse and
    better for regular use.  Not that other dialects can't be introduced
    later, but they aren't as necessary now.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.27.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.24.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.20.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.19.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    0.16.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (D.pm, Basics.pod)  In the ENTITY NAMES section of Basics.pod,
    refactored the builtins namespaces to unify them under 'sys'; so what
    used to be ['cat','sys','imp'] are now ['sys.cat','sys.std','sys.imp']
    respectively.  The VERSIONING section of D.pm had a corresponding
    update.  However, all the standard Muldis D routine and type
    definitions or references in the Core/* and Ext/* and Dialect/* etc
    files were *not* updated yet to the new naming scheme; those
    documentation files will be updated piecemeal instead when they already
    need to be updated for some other reason, especially for a related
    global change; meanwhile, though most pod doesn't show it, the new
    'sys.std' names are the actual official ones.  Also, 'mnt' was split
    into itself and 'mnt.cat', the latter being where the system catalog
    for controlling depot mounts actually now is.

    * (Basics.pod)  In the ENTITY NAMES section, public-invokable types
    and routines no longer have to be confined in packages, but can exist
    directly in a depot or subdepot instead.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added generic literal syntax for
    selecting a value of any scalar or quasi-scalar type which has at least
    1 possrep.  The syntax is similar to a tuple literal, but rather than
    being "Tuple:{ <attr names and values> }" it is "Scalar:<type
    name>:<possrep name>:{ <possrep attr names and values> }".  This
    feature fills in a useability hole where previously it wasn't possible
    to have literals of most scalar types in a bootloader, and such values
    required the writing of a whole (temporary) routine to generate them.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the literal syntax for a Cat.NameChain so
    its 'seq' representation now has square brackets around the name parts.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Refactored
    the catalog types for defining value expressions and routine
    statements.  Routine parameters and variables are now invokable
    directly in expressions and statements, and are no longer invokable by
    way of 'param' or 'var' etc expression nodes.  Expression nodes and
    parameters and variables are now invoked using Cat.NameChain rather
    than Cat.Name (the implementing change was in Cat.NameExprMap), which
    allows you both to access their attributes with minimal syntax, but
    also normalizes the syntax for local and global variable access.  The 2
    types Cat.ProcStmtArg(|Set) were eliminated since, following the above
    changes, Cat.NameExprMap could be used instead for defining procedure
    statement arguments; then the Cat.E_PSAK enumerated type had no more
    uses, and was eliminated.  The 2 types Cat.(|Multi)UpdStmt were merged
    into the 1 type Cat.MultiUpdStmt, which otherwise is essentially the
    same as the old version.  The 3 types Cat.Expr(Node|Set|Tree) were
    refactored into the 6 types
    Cat.(|(Sca|ScaPR|Tup|Rel)Lit|FuncInvo)ExprNodeSet; the first of those
    is a tuple with 5 attributes, one each of the other 5 of those, which
    are relations; so then an inner routine that used to have a
    Cat.Expr(Set|Tree) attribute now has a Cat.ExprNodeSet attribute
    instead; then the Cat.E_ENK enumerated type had no more uses, and was
    eliminated.  With the previous changes, code for expressions or
    statements no longer has any inapplicable attributes, save relations
    allowed to be empty.  Along with their types, the special literal
    syntax for Cat.E_ENK and Cat.E_PSAK was eliminated from the 2 Tiny
    dialects.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added new
    scalar type Cat.DeclNameChain, as well as its own literal syntax in
    both Tiny dialects.  This type is the same as Cat.NameChain except that
    it allows 0..N name parts rather than 2..N, and its flat possrep also
    has periods before and after the parts rather than just between them.
    This type was added for use when declaring subdepots, depot entities.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Added a set of 4 top-level catalog types which
    are the types of the Muldis D catalog dbvars: Cat.System (for
    'sys.cat'), Cat.Federation (for 'fed.cat'), Cat.Depot (for 'dep.cat'
    and 'sdp.cat'), Cat.Package (for 'pkg.cat').  Added a set of 2 catalog
    types which define nodes in N-depth namespace hierarchies for
    organizing entities within a catalog: Cat.SysNspSet (hierarchies for
    system-defined entities), Cat.SubdepotSet (hierarchies for user-defined
    entities, for example SQL 'schema'); these 2 only declare that
    namespaces exist, not what entities are in them.  Added a set of 11
    catalog types which specify/embed the definitions of entities in
    catalog dbvars: Cat.DepotMountSet (what depot mounts are in a mount
    federation), Cat.PackageSet (what packages are in a depot),
    Cat.Sys(Func|Upd|Proc)Set (what system-defined routines there are),
    Cat.(Dep|Pkg)(Func|Upd|Proc)Set (what user-defined routines there are,
    directly in a depot or in a package of a depot, respectively); for the
    system-defined routines, only the routine headings/interfaces are
    specified, and for user-defined ones, both those and the
    bodies/implementations are specified.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Refactored the catalog types for defining
    main|outer and inner routines, so that routine headings and bodies are
    now separate from each other, and routine declared names are now
    external to both parts; that is, a routine's name, if it has one, is
    supplied by whatever other type embeds the otherwise anonymous routine
    definition.  The 11 types Cat.(|Inner)(Func|Updater|Proc) and
    Cat.Inner(Func|Updater)(Set|Tree) and Cat.InnerProcTree were refactored
    into the 12 types Cat.(Func|Upd|Proc)(Head|Body) and
    Cat.Inner(Func|Upd|Proc)(Body|Set).  Following this refactoring plus
    the previous change item, the 'name' attribute for named functions is
    directly in each of the 12 Cat.(Sys|Dep|Pkg|Inner)(Func|Upd|Proc)Set
    types; all 12 have a 'head' attribute and all but the Sys have a 'body'
    attribute, those embedding appropriate Head and Body types, the 3
    together completely defining the routine.  Both outer and inner
    routines of the same kind use the same Head types, but have their own
    Body types.  Another change this refactoring brought is that an outer
    routine no longer requires an inner routine to define its own
    interface; now an outer routine body embeds its implementation detail
    (still an inner routine Body) directly, rather than it being a list
    item in an inner routines list whose name is the empty string;
    therefore, outer routines no longer need to have inner routines at all
    unless they do certain things.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Despite the widescale refactoring, these 10
    catalog types transitioned from the previous to the current design
    while retaining their names and purpose, and also all or most of their
    own design details: Cat.Name, Cat.NameChain, Cat.Comment,
    Cat.SeqOfProcStmt, Cat.ProcStmt, Cat.NameTypeMap, NameExprMap,
    AttrRenameMap, SetOfName, Cat.SetOfNameExprMap.  Also some minor typo
    fixes with a few of the 9 QuasiCat type docs, but the whole block was
    left alone and still fits in fine.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  The following 6 catalog types were not addressed
    yet and still need to be rewritten/refactored: Cat.E_TK, Cat.E_TDM,
    Cat.Type, Cat.Exception, Cat.SetOfSetOfName, Cat.SetOfNameChain.  More
    generally speaking, the catalog types for defining data types (and
    databases) still need to be rewritten, or actually they mostly need to
    be written in the first place.  Hopefully by the next Muldis D release.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  In the process of the other changes, the 3
    largest main documentation sections, "SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE CATALOG (
    SCALAR | TUPLE | RELATION ) DATA TYPES", were reorganized into the 10
    main documentation sections "TYPES FOR DEFINING ( ENTITY NAMES AND
    COMMENTS | SYSTEM-DEFINED ENTITIES | FEDERATIONS | DEPOTS AND SUBDEPOTS
    | PACKAGES | ROUTINE HEADINGS | ROUTINE BODIES | INNER ROUTINE BODIES
    )" and "SIMPLE GENERIC CATALOG COLLECTION TYPES" and "OLD TYPE
    DEFINITIONS TO REWRITE OR REPLACE".

    * Muldis::D version 0.26.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.26.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.26.0 and Types_Catalog.pod 0.23.0 and
    Routines.pod 0.22.0 and Basics.pod 0.19.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.18.0 and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.15.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the routine kind 'main' to
    'bootloader' and updated its description.  This routine kind is now not
    so much a "main program" as it is more like a thin wrapper that loads
    and invokes the main from a depot.  A bootloader can be used by both
    plain text and hosted data Muldis D, not just the former; it can also
    be split into pieces.  Also added the bootloader_exclusive routine kind
    which is a system service that can only be called by a bootloader,
    examples being distinct transaction initiation and termination
    statements.  Most updates were in the ROUTINES and TRANSACTIONS AND
    CONCURRENCY and RESOURCE MODULARITY AND PERSISTENCE sections of
    Basics.pod, and in the DESCRIPTION of PTMD_Tiny.pod.

    * (Routines.pod)  Added new SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE BOOTLOADER EXCLUSIVES
    with 3 new sys.Core.Control.(start|commit|rollback)_trans routines.

    * (Basics.pod)  In the ENTITY NAMES section, refactored the
    fed|dep|sdp|pkg namespaces so that each has cat|lib|data secondary
    namespaces.  The 'lib' namespace retains the type and routine
    invocation names while 'data' now represents a dbvar and it replaces
    all the '<relvar>'; this change was made to emphasize the fact that
    there is just a single global variable (per scope) for user data, and
    that relvars are just pseudo-variable components of a dbvar.  The new
    'cat' secondary namespaces, each a dbvar, are now the parts of the
    system catalog for user-defined entities, and the 'cat' primary
    namespace is now just a dbcon for system-defined entities.  Added new
    'mnt' primary namespace catalog dbvar to countrol what depot mounts
    exist, rather than that being under the 'cat' primary.  Also indicated
    that type definitions can have inner routines, and routine definitions
    can have inner types; that is there are both inner and outer types now.

    * (Basics.pod)  In ENTITY NAMES, added "Terse Pseudo-Variable Syntax"
    section which specifies that you can indeed use extended entity names
    to directly reference components of eg tuples, such as by writing
    "tupvar.attrname" rather than having to say "attr( tupvar, attrname )"
    or "assign( tupvar.attrname, 42 )" rather than "assign( tupvar,
    update_attr( tupvar, attrname, 42 ) )".

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Formalized
    the Cat.NameChain type with actual possrep names, and updated it to
    require a minimum of 2 chain elements; also deleted the superfluous
    types Cat.NESeqOfName and Cat.FlattenedNameChain, which have been
    merged into Cat.NameChain as informal inner types.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Supplemented the HDMD_Perl_Tiny
    dialect so you can define whole bootloader routines in it as you
    already could with the PTMD_Tiny dialect; added 2 new pod sections /
    PHMD node types BOOTLOADER and BOOTLOADER PROCEDURE CALL.  Updated the
    PTMD_Tiny dialect to rename the 'start' token to 'bootloader', and
    'procedure_call' to 'bootloader_procedure_call'; the latter now starts
    with the literal text 'boot_call' rather than 'Call'.

2008-04-13  Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.25.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.25.1.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.25.1 and Basics.pod 0.18.1 and
    SeeAlso.pod 0.4.1.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (D.pm, Basics.pod, SeeAlso.pod)  A few minor updates to reflect the
    fact that the Muldis D main reference implementation is now named
    Muldis Rosetta rather than Muldis DB.

2008-04-07  Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.25.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.25.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: D.pm 0.25.0 and Types.pod and
    Types_Catalog.pod and Ordered.pod and Integer.pod and Blob.pod and
    Text.pod and Set.pod and Sequence.pod and Bag.pod and Rational.pod
    0.22.0 and Basics.pod 0.18.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.17.0 and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.14.0 and Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod 0.7.0.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (D.pm)  The TRADEMARK POLICY section was severely edited to excise
    most legalese, and is now just half its previous size; the old longer
    version was shunted off to the Muldis Data Systems' website.

    * (D.pm, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the quasi-constant
    second (authority) part of a fully-qualified name format for a Muldis D
    language variant, applicable only to the official/original (not
    embraced and extended) variants, from 'cpan:DUNCAND' to
    'http://muldis.com'.  This is because the main web address of Muldis
    Data Systems more closely represents the official authority on Muldis
    D, rather than CPAN which is more just a forum for publishing it.

    * (Basics.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated the "main" routine kind to
    specify that it can not have any lexical variables or inner routines;
    all a "main" can do is invoke procedures that have no subject-to-update
    parameters.

    * (Basics.pod)  The standard system-defined entities may now have fully
    qualified names that are 3 or more parts (including the "sys") rather
    than exactly 4 parts, which allows for more elegant naming schemes.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, Integer.pod,
    Blob.pod, Text.pod, Rational.pod, Temporal.pod, Spatial.pod)  Renamed
    all the data types declared in Types.pod to substitute 'Type' for
    '(Universal|((|Quasi)(Scalar|Tuple|Relation)|Remnant|Spec)'; then
    renamed the 4 'D0' types to distinguish them again, and renamed 'E_D'
    to 'QuasiScalarDVPT'.  Renamed all the data types declared in
    Types_Catalog.pod to insert a '.Type' before their '.(|Quasi)Cat'.
    Then all the Core types were named 'sys.Core.Type(|.(|Quasi)Cat).\w+'.
    Renamed all the data types declared in
    (Integer|Blob|Text|Rational|Spatial).pod so that they have names like
    'sys.<extension>.Type.\w+'; the previous 3rd name part was either
    redundant with the extension name or was '(Cat|Spec)'.  Renamed all the
    data types declared in Temporal.pod from 'sys.Temporal.(With|No)TZ.\w+'
    to 'sys.Temporal.Type.\w+(With|No)TZ'.

    * (Ordered.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod, Text.pod, Set.pod, Sequence.pod,
    Bag.pod, Rational.pod)  Renamed all the routines whose third name parts
    were redundant with their second name parts, to remove the third parts.

    * (Types.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod)  Removed the system-defined
    types NE(Blob|Text) and updated the few system-defined functions using
    them to use Blob|Text instead.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, Integer.pod, Rational.pod)  Removed the
    Cat.PInt2_36 type from the core and placed duplicate copies of it under
    altered names in both the integer and rational extensions.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the DESCRIPTION, as well as the Name and
    Comment descriptions.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated the
    Cat.E_ENK and Cat.E_PSAK types to remove each of their 'default'
    values.  Users now always specify the use of type-default values
    explicitly, using either generic literal or function invocation
    expressions, which makes user code more self-documenting and saves on
    some catalog complexity; that said, some Muldis D dialects may still
    have a short-hand for 'default'.

    * (Types_Catalog.pod)  Updated the Cat.ExprNode and Cat.ProcStmtArg
    types to remove each of their 'type' attributes.  Users now always do
    an explicit 'treated' func call when they need to, or otherwise the
    data type at each of these nodes is now just inferred from context, and
    so Muldis D is now more like a typical programming language as to what
    it requires users to explicitly say.

2008-03-22  Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::D version 0.24.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.24.0.tar.gz.

    * What was Language-MuldisD at version 0.23.0 has been renamed to
    Muldis-D.  This is the first release of the Muldis-D distribution, and
    the first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 package names
    like Muldis::D(|::\w+).  All of the files in this distribution are as
    identical as possible to how they were when last released under the
    names Language::MuldisD(|::\w+) but for the name changes.  All lib/
    files were renamed appropriately, and also the one t/LMD_00_Compile.t
    was renamed to t/Muldis_D_00_Compile.t.

    * All versioned files had their version numbers incremented to the
    first higher 0.N.0.  New file versions are: D.pm 0.24.0 and Core.pod
    and Types.pod and Types_Catalog.pod and Routines.pod and Ordered.pod
    and Integer.pod and Blob.pod and Text.pod and Nonscalar.pod and Set.pod
    and Sequence.pod and Bag.pod and Rational.pod 0.21.0 and Basics.pod
    0.17.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.16.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.13.0 and
    Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod 0.6.0 and SeeAlso.pod 0.4.0 and
    Hierarchical.pod and Conventions.pod 0.1.0.

    * Updated D.pm and the README file to clarify that commercial support
    is available from the author specifically by way of Muldis Data
    Systems.

    * Updated all .pm and .pod files to add a new TRADEMARK POLICY section
    near the end of each; it serves for trademarks what the LICENSE AND
    COPYRIGHT did for copyrights.  The D.pm file had the actual text, and
    the other files simply say to look at D.pm.  To summarize, the word
    MULDIS is a trademark and how you may use it has limitations.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Updated the "Muldis DB for Perl 6" implementation
    reference to say that it is now a secondary version, and that the Perl
    5 version is now the only main muldis D implementation.  Generally
    speaking, it does not help the adoption of Muldis D if we are giving
    the impression that it has a dependency that most people don't have
    and/or isn't ready for production use, namely Perl 6, and Perl 5 should
    be given more support in the meantime.

    * (Basics.pod, Ordered.pod)  Minor fixes.

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.23.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.23.0.tar.gz.

    * Reverted the only change made in release 0.22.1, by recombining the 6
    files Core(|/\w+).pod back into the single file Core.pod; it would then
    be split apart again but in a different way.  For simplicity of
    documentation, the rest of the release 0.23.0 change items are written
    from the point of view of starting with the combined Core.pod.

    * Pulled apart Core.pod to turn as much of it as possible into language
    extensions, leaving the remaining core as minimalist as possible, such
    that it contains barely more than what is needed to both bootstrap the
    Muldis D language and satisfy the mandatory parts of "The Third
    Manifesto".  The minimized core still provides the full system catalog
    complexity, but has relatively few system-defined generic data types
    and system-defined operators.  There were 9 new Ext/\w+.pod files
    created out of the reductions: Ordered.pod, Integer.pod, Blob.pod,
    Text.pod, Nonscalar.pod, Set.pod, Sequence.pod, Bag.pod, Rational.pod.
    Details of what each contains appear below.

    * Re-split apart Core.pod 4 ways, into itself and 3 new files, all of
    which have the same names of and correspond to the files of the same
    names that release 0.22.1 had: Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod,
    Routines.pod.  In that respect, then, release 0.23.0 actually served to
    just eliminate the 2 files Functions_(S|Nons)calar.pod, whose contents
    were either merged into Routines.pod or spread out into the 9 new Ext
    files; and some smaller portions of Types(|_Catalog).pod were also
    moved out into some of the 9 new Ext files.  Details pre-split follow.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.23.0 and Core.pod and Types.pod
    and Types_Catalog.pod and Routines.pod and Ordered.pod and Integer.pod
    and Blob.pod and Text.pod and Nonscalar.pod and Set.pod and
    Sequence.pod and Bag.pod and Rational.pod 0.20.0 and Basics.pod 0.16.0
    and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.15.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.12.0 and Temporal.pod
    0.5.3.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Ordered.pod, Core.pod, Temporal.pod)  Removed the Ordered union
    type; from now on, any type is potentialy orderable based on what
    functions exist for it, not by its type declaration.  Also removed the
    4 Spec.\w+ofOrdered types.  Any routine declarations that used Ordered
    before now use Universal instead.  Moved all sys.Core.Ordered.\w+
    functions to Ordered.pod from Core.pod, renaming them to
    sys.Ordered.Ord.\w+.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the Cat.ScalarLiteral type; from now on, the
    limitations of what values can be used for the scal_lit attribute of
    Cat.ExprNode are either dialect-defined or implementation-defined; all
    others can still be defined using the 'func' attribute.

    * (Basics.pod, Rational.pod, Core.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod,
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Demoted the Rat types from the language core into
    a language extension.  Moved all sys.Core.Rat.\w+ types (plus the
    sys.Core.Spec\w+ofRat types) and functions to Rational.pod from
    Core.pod, renaming the 'Core' to 'Rational'. Likewise moved and renamed
    the 3 rational-specific catalog types [PInt2_N, E_RM, RatRoundRule].
    Updated Basics.pod to reflect this.  Rearranged PTMD_Tiny.pod and
    HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod to move their elements for Rat and E_RM literals to
    the end of the files, where language extension literals now go.

    * (Integer.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.Int.\w+ functions (plus
    the sys.Core.Spec\w+of(Int|UInt) types) to Integer.pod from Core.pod,
    renaming the 'Core' to 'Integer'.

    * (Blob.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.Blob.\w+ functions (plus the
    sys.Core.Spec\w+ofBlob types) to Blob.pod from Core.pod, renaming the
    'Core' to 'Blob'.  Likewise moved and renamed the blob-specific catalog
    type PInt1_4.

    * (Text.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.Text.\w+ functions (plus the
    sys.Core.Spec\w+ofText types) to Text.pod from Core.pod, renaming the
    'Core' to 'Text'.

    * (Core.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Renamed all 8
    sys.Core.(Bool|Int|Text|Blob).\w+ remaining types to
    sys.Core.Scalar.\w+.  So now all the generic core types have names in
    the just 8 main type groupings: Scalar, Tuple, Relation, their 3 Quasi
    counterparts, Universal, Remnant.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the 4 Spec.\w+ofScalar types.  So now the only
    similar such types left in the core are the 4 Spec.\w+ofBool ones;
    collapsed the mention of them under TYPE SUMMARY into a footnote.

    * (Nonscalar.pod, Core.pod)  Moved 31 (about 3/7) of the
    sys.Core.(Tuple|Relation).\w+ functions to Nonscalar.pod from Core.pod,
    renaming the 'Core' to 'Nonscalar'.  The moved were in 5 groups, the
    first being all Tuple.\w+, the remaining 4 all Relation.\w+.  Group 1
    had these 4: degree, attr_from_Tuple, Tuple_from_attr,
    substitution_in_default.  Group 2 had these 11: degree,
    is(|_not)_empty, empty, universal, power_set, negation,
    transitive_closure, (|maybe_)reduction, map.  Group 3 had these 5:
    is(|_not)_proper_subset, exclusion, composition, join_with_group. Group
    4 had these 6: (|static_)substitution(|_in_(restriction|semijoin)).
    Group 5 had these 5:
    outer_join_with_(group|maybes|defaults|product|extension).

    * (Set.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.(Set|Maybe).\w+ functions to
    Set.pod from Core.pod, renaming the 'Core' to 'Set'.

    * (Sequence.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.Seq.\w+ functions to
    Sequence.pod from Core.pod, renaming the 'Core' to 'Sequence'.

    * (Bag.pod, Core.pod) Moved all sys.Core.Bag.\w+ functions to Bag.pod
    from Core.pod, renaming the 'Core' to 'Bag'.

    * Following all the above moves, there were 56 operators (53 functions,
    1 updater, 2 procedures) remaining in Core.pod; of those, the
    'Universal' namespace had 5 functions and 1 updater, the 'Bool'
    namespace had 6 functions, the 'Tuple' namespace had 10 functions, the
    'Relation' namespace had 33 functions, and the 'Control' namespace had
    2 procedures.

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.22.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.22.1.tar.gz.

    * This release takes place on a rare February 29th.

    * This release is minimalist and serves only to split up the file
    Core.pod into itself plus 5 new files, all named Core/\w+.pod:
    Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, Routines.pod, Functions_Scalar.pod,
    Functions_Nonscalar.pod.  This split was done mainly to make the
    information easier to maintain and to read.  Where the original file
    was 168KB, the largest of the new files is 60KB.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.22.1 and Core.pod 0.19.1 (all 5
    Core/\w+.pod started at 0.19.1 also).  The other pre-existing versioned
    files are unchanged.

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.22.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.22.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.22.0 and Core.pod 0.19.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.15.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.14.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    0.11.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new "Numeric Types" pod subsection under TYPE
    SYSTEM, which outlines what features concerning numeric data are and
    are not provided by the Muldis D language core.  To summarize, the core
    numerics are all exact radix-independent "bignum", suitable for all
    magnitude of rational or floating-point numbers; no special values like
    NaNs or infinities are provided, they are left to language extensions.

    * (Core.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the rounding
    method 'to_even' to 'half_even' and added 2 more rounding methods
    'half_down' and 'to_inf'; the 2 complement 'half_up' and 'to_zero'.

    * (Core.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Enhanced the Rat
    numeric type so it now has 2 actual possreps, defined over Ints, called
    'ratio' (2 attrs) and 'float' (3 attrs), rather than having zero actual
    possreps and just a conceptual ratio one.  The 'float' possrep is
    intended to make it easier to deal with numbers in scientific notation,
    which is particularly useful for very large or very small numbers.
    Added the 4 functions Rat.Rat_from_Int_triple and
    Rat.(mantissa|radix|exponent) to reflect the 'float' possrep.  (But
    note that these such functions are deprecated for generic scalar ones.)
    In PTMD_Tiny, added a third format for specifying Rat literals, named
    'float', which looks like 'Rat:float:9:314159*10^-5'; also renamed the
    'pair' format to 'ratio'.  In HDMD_Perl_Tiny, updated the PHMD node for
    Rat literals to add some 'float' formats and rename the 'pair' formats.

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.21.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.21.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.21.0 and Core.pod 0.18.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.14.1 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.13.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
    0.10.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm, Basics.pod)  Updated the paradigm list of Muldis D to
    add the word "homoiconic", which I just learned about today and which
    is strongly descriptive of any "D" language, especially of Muldis D.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Renamed the 'treat' function to 'treated';
    renamed the 'v' parameter of that and the 'is_value_of_type' function
    to 'topic'.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the notes on a complete tuple|relation types'
    cardinalities to say specifically how to calculate them, rather than
    generally saying it is done using permutations.

    * (Core.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added new scalar
    catalog data type sys.Core.Cat.Comment which represents a Muldis D code
    comment that programmers can attach to various catalog elements; it is
    also useful for preserving comments translated to/from other languages.
    This type is the same as Text|Name but is disjoint from both.  Also
    added a new Comment token or PHMD node type to both Tiny dialects.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated most (11) of the tuple catalog types to add a
    'comment' attribute to each, so code comments can be attached to code
    in the most appropriate places possible, such as to individual
    expression nodes or to whole statements or to whole routines.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the 2 functions sys.Core.Relation.un(wrap|group)
    to add the new 'inner' argument, which resolves ambiguity of what
    attribute names are being added for the result when the input relation
    has no tuples (and the MST of every input relation attribute is Empty).

    * (Core.pod)  Added the 4 functions
    Relation.static_(extension|substitution(|_in_(restriction|semijoin)))
    which are all simpler-syntax versions their 'static_'-less counterparts
    where the values being added or substituted are the same for every
    tuple, so there is no need to incur a conceptual function call per
    input tuple.  So now every Muldis D function with a function parameter
    now has an alternate specialized variant which handles certain common
    cases, without a function parameter.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the function sys.Core.Tuple.multi_update as a
    short-hand for multiple update_attr; in fact it is necessary in cases
    where the latter would otherwise be used but a type constraint would
    require multiple attribute updates as a unit.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the function sys.Core.Tuple.substitution_in_default
    which should help users write less verbose Muldis D code where they can
    just specify parts of a desired tuple value and let the rest be filled
    in with default attributes for the desired tuple's type.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Updated specifier for called procedure name so it
    can be in both formats that a Cat.NameChain can have.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Added support for
    quasi-nonscalar literals as per nonscalar literals.

2008-02-07  Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.20.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.20.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.20.0 and Core.pod 0.17.2 and
    Basics.pod 0.14.0 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.12.0 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.9.0
    and SeeAlso.pod 0.3.4.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Renamed the constant
    first part of a fully-qualified name format for a Muldis D language
    variant, from 'MuldisD' to 'Muldis_D'.  This is to help not perpetuate
    the myth that the normal/correct way to spell the language name is with
    MuldisD (1 word) rather than Muldis D (2 words); I have already seen a
    number of places using that shortened form, incorrectly.  Note that the
    only reason the package name has them rammed together is because that
    is normal practice for Perl namespaces, which the spec is written
    under.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod, PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod,
    SeeAlso.pod)  Rewrote the "Representation" POD sub-section of the
    "MULDIS D" POD main section of Basics.pod, which included renaming the
    "Concrete" and "Abstract" dialect groupings to "Plain Text" and "Hosted
    Data".  Then renamed any references to said groupings in all 5 files.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Rewrote most of the DESCRIPTION
    pod in light of both the "Representation" change and MuldisD.pm's new
    VERSIONING section, to conform to them and remove redundancies.  Also
    smaller changes for the same reasons in other parts of the 2 Tiny
    files.  In HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod, split the GENERAL STRUCTURE pod section
    into itself and LANGUAGE NAME, the latter portion being rewritten.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Shortened the syntax for a
    Cat.Name value, which huffmanizes the grammars more and also allows
    other improvements.  The cat_name grammar token no longer specifies a
    "Cat.Name:" prefix, and the Cat.Name phmd node is now simply a Perl Str
    rather than being a 2-element Array; any parsing context that is
    expecting a generic literal grammar token or generic phmd node will
    interpret a character string without metadata as being a Cat.Name.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Updated every nonscalar literal
    grammar token and phmd node to remove its element that specifies a
    predefined type name which constrains/defines the literal's heading.
    This meta-data was verbosity that couldn't really be used except within
    the DBMS, wherein it already existed there in code definitions that is
    processing the literals.  As an exception to this straight-removal, for
    plain relation literals, a new replacement feature was added for the
    removed, which specifies the relation's attribute list when the
    relation has no tuples to provide that information.  Given that this
    attribute list is formatted differently than a tuple list, just one of
    those things appears in a relation literal, and a parser can easily
    distinguish between them.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod, HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod)  Fleshed out or fixed the
    syntaxes for specifying Cat.NameChain literals.

    * (PTMD_Tiny.pod)  Added the syntax to call procedures, thus making a
    PTMD_Tiny code file actually able to represent a Muldis D 'main'
    routine, and hence actually represent a program; which is simply a
    sequence of procedure calls following a language name declaration.  The
    literal-defining syntax which still makes up most of the grammar is now
    specifically for defining arguments for the procedure calls

2008-02-07  Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.19.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.19.1.tar.gz.

    * This release is very minimalist, serving to rename a few files, and
    do as little as possible otherwise.  It seemed best to do all actual
    file content changes separately, so that it is easy to do
    same-file-name diffs on consecutive distro versions and see what
    content changed.

    * Renamed Grammar.pod to Dialect/PTMD_Tiny.pod, and PerlHosted.pod to
    Dialect/HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod.  Correspondingly renamed the pseudo-package
    names (what the NAME pod says) in those files.  Then updated all the
    other distro files to refer to the 2 renamed by their new names.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.19.1 and Core.pod 0.17.1 and
    Basics.pod 0.13.1 and PTMD_Tiny.pod 0.11.1 and HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod 0.8.1
    and Hierarchical.pod 0.0.3.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

2008-02-03  Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.19.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.19.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.19.0 and Core.pod 0.17.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.13.0 and Grammar.pod 0.11.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.8.0 and
    Hierarchical.pod and Conventions.pod 0.0.2.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm)  Added new main pod section VERSIONING which explains
    the fully-qualified name formats of Muldis D variants in a generic
    manner, so to help make the Muldis D code more future-proof.  Updated
    the related DESCRIPTION paragraph.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Renamed the 2 operators is(|_not)_equal to
    is(|_not)_identical, which is arguably less ambiguous on what they are
    testing for.  Also renamed their parameters from v(1|2) to
    (topic|other); the parameters are still commutative, though.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the 2 operators is_(increase|decrease_or_same) to
    is(|_not)_before, and eliminated the 2 operators
    is_(decrease|increase_or_same); considering that all Muldis D
    parameters are named rather than ordered, the eliminated operators are
    completely redundant with invoking the 2 kept ones with the arguments
    swapped, and order-specific variants are not helpful.  Also renamed
    their parameters as per the is_identical change.  This elimination also
    brings more parity with other parts of the language that considered
    only-position-swapped variants useless, such as the presence of
    is_subset but no is_superset.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Eliminated the Cat.Order
    type, which currently doesn't seem to be that useful after all (if this
    judgement was wrong, it could be brought back later).  Eliminated the
    corresponding grammar token and PHMD node kind.  Eliminated the 2
    Ordered.(|reverse_)comparison functions.  Eliminated the 4
    Cat.Order_\w+ functions.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Renamed the Just type to
    Single (and QuasiJust to QuasiSingle); while breaking from the
    Haskell-inspired triple, it reads better for Muldis D, and is more
    descriptive.

    * (Core.pod)  Added 3 functions sys.Core.Maybe.(nothing|single|attr)
    where the first 2 will select a Nothing or Single value respectively,
    and the last one will extract the payload of a known-Just value.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the 2 functions Int.(in|de)crease to
    Int.(in|de)crement.

    * (Core.pod)  Added an initial complement of 5 relational functions to
    do half-outer natural joins in different ways,
    Relation.outer_join_with_(group|maybes|defaults|product|extension);
    also added inner join variant of the first, Relation.join_with_group.
    The 2 'group' functions are intended as convenient tools for gathering
    both parent and child records from a database using a single query
    while avoiding duplication of the parent record values.

    * (Core.pod, Hierarchical.pod, Conventions.pod)  Other minor updates.

2008-01-25   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.18.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.18.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.18.0 and Core.pod 0.16.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.12.0 and Grammar.pod 0.10.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.7.0 and
    Hierarchical.pod and Conventions.pod 0.0.1.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated TYPE SYSTEM to remove the requirement where
    every value must have exactly one most-specific-type / MST, which is
    supposed to exist in a generic "D" language to assist some kinds of
    polymorphism.  Although that restriction is still generally followed
    for all system-defined types, and it would ideally be the case for all
    user-defined types, the design of Muldis D does not generally require a
    value to have a single MST in order to work, and moreover to enforce
    the single-MST requirement would place an undue burden on users, who
    would typically need to define many gratuitous types to satisfy it.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the "Tuple Types and Relation Types" subsection
    of TYPE SYSTEM to directly explain that any 2 zero-tuple relation
    values of the same degree and with the same attribute names are
    considered identical, regardless of the declared types of those
    attributes in the code that produced them; every attribute of a
    zero-tuple relation value has an MST of Empty, which is a subtype of
    every other type.  A consequence is that every Set|Maybe or Seq or Bag
    type's single zero-tuple value is identical to every other's one.

    * (Core.pod)  Further echoing the design of Haskell's "Maybe" feature,
    added 2 complementary subtypes of Maybe named
    sys.Core.Relation.(Nothing|Just), which have exactly zero tuples or 1
    tuple, respectively; the Nothing type has exactly 1 value of Maybe, and
    the Just type has all the rest of them.  Nothing is Muldis D's answer
    to the SQL NULL, in that it is meant as a marker that a value is
    unknown or inapplicable; but unlike SQL, Nothing is an actual value,
    and it does equal itself.  Just is the same container, that always does
    hold exactly one value.  Also added the 2 subtypes Quasi(Nothing|Just).

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Took the explicit grammar token or
    PHMD node type specific to the Maybe type, and replaced it with two
    that are specific to the Nothing or Just types, where each
    more-specialized replacement has simpler syntax than what it replaced.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Rounded out /
    added better symmetry to the type system by adding the concept of a
    quasi-scalar type and adding the system-defined QuasiScalar maximal
    type.  Since there are no normal system-defined quasi-scalar types from
    which that new maximal would draw a default value (all normal
    quasi-scalar types are expected to be user-defined, if they exist at
    all), also added the QuasiScalar.E_D subtype which exists soley for
    that purpose.  Also added the system-defined Remnant maximal type, and
    that already had the pre-existing ScaTupRel normal system-defined type
    from which to draw a default value.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the ExprNode|ProcStmtArg attribute 'tk' and
    InnerFunc attribute 'result_tk', due to seemingly not being too useful.

    * (Core.pod)  Added constraint to trees of expression nodes or inner
    routines such that any node which is the sole tree root in its context
    must have the empty string as its name.  These 4 catalog data types now
    have that constraint added: ExprTree, Inner(Func|Updater|Proc)Tree.
    Removed the no-longer-needed 'root_\w+' attribute from each of these 4
    catalog data types: InnerFunc, Func, Updater, Proc.  Some small fixes.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the 2 functions Ordered.is_(in|de)crease_or_same,
    which are to is_(in|de)crease what '>='|'<=' are to '>'|'<'.  With this
    addition, all 6 of the common binary compare operators [=,!=,<,>,<=,>=]
    are directly represented, so no need to emulate over several functions.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the 3 functions Relation.disjoint_(insertion|union)
    and Set.disjoint_insertion; they are the same as the non-disjoint
    versions but that they fail if there are duplicate tuples|elements
    rather than succeeding as a full or partial no-op.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod, Hierarchical.pod, Conventions.pod)  Other
    minor updates.

2008-01-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.17.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.17.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.17.0 and Core.pod 0.15.0 and
    Grammar.pod 0.9.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.6.0.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.  Added 2 new files
    lib/Language/MuldisD/Hierarchical.pod and
    lib/Language/MuldisD/Conventions.pod, each of which start at version
    0.0.0.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the Cat.InnerFunc type to add a couple missing
    attributes, result_tk and result_type.

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Removed the explicit grammar tokens or
    PHMD node types that were specific to these 7 Muldis D types: UInt,
    PInt, URat, PRat, NEBlob, NEText, Database.  So now just these 14 ones
    are directly supported: Bool, Int, Rat, Blob, Text, Tuple, Relation,
    Set, Maybe, Seq, Bag, Cat.Name, Cat.NameChain, Cat.Order.  This change
    was made to remove unnecessary complexity from the grammar/PHMD specs;
    now for the most part there is now only 1 distinct grammar token or
    PHMD node type for each core Muldis D root type (so the removed are
    covered by their remaining parents); non-root types generally only have
    their own when they also have a syntactic short-hand to take advantage
    of.  Any otherwise orphaned examples were updated to the parent syntax.
    Also removed the 'index' variant of Seq from Grammar, leaving just the
    ordered variant, which was all PerlHosted had anyway.  And updated the
    'count' variant of Bag to do itself what it had used a PInt token/node
    to do.

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Upgraded the specification formats for
    rationals so that now any rational value can be directly selected, not
    just those whose denominators are powers of 2..36; for example, you can
    now select the rational 1/43 directly where you couldn't before.  To
    facilitate this, there are now 2 formats you can define a rational in,
    the previous 'N.N' format, called 'radix', and the new 'N/N' format,
    called 'pair'; in PerlHosted, the latter is given as 2 elements, not 1.

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Added grammar tokens and PHMD node
    types for all the not yet covered enumerated scalar catalog types:
    Cat.E_RM, Cat.E_TK, Cat.E_TDM, Cat.E_ENK, Cat.E_PSAK.  So that fills in
    all the remaining gaps in those files and it is now possible to either
    directly select any Muldis D value or directly define the system
    catalog entries of any Muldis D code that would.

    * (Hierarchical.pod)  This new file has begun to outline an additional
    official dialect of Muldis D, which is terse and intended for normal
    use for writing code in, or writing code examples in, unlike the
    'catalog' dialect which is damningly verbose for normal use.

    * (Conventions.pod)  This new file is a style guide, and mainly starts
    off with suggesting good ways to name entities.

    * (Core.pod)  Other minor updates.

2008-01-05   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.16.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.16.0.tar.gz.

    * This release coincides with the 5th anniversary of the first CPAN
    release of the first Muldis D / Muldis DB progenitor; DBIx::Portable
    version 0.01 was released on 2003 January 5th.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.16.0 and Core.pod 0.14.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.11.0 and Grammar.pod 0.8.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.5.0.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files have their version numbers all
    incremented by 0.0.1.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Renamed the routine kinds update_operator and
    inner_update_operator to the shorter 'updater' and 'inner_updater',
    though the terms 'update operator' and 'updater' will continue to be
    interchangeable.  Also renamed 6 corresponding catalog types to
    UpdStmt, MultiUpdStmt, InnerUpdater, InnerUpdaterSet, InnerUpdaterTree,
    Updater, and renamed any referencing attributes as appropriate.

    * (Core.pod)  Reformatted all the routine signatures to look more
    natural for Muldis D, rather than being mostly identical to the Perl 6
    routine signature format.  The format for function declarations is now
    "function foo result Bar params { baz(Quux) }" rather than "foo of Bar
    (Quux $baz)", and the format for updater or procedure declarations is
    now "updater|procedure foo update { fi(Fum) } read { baz(Quux) }"
    rather than "foo (UPD: Fum $fi ; RO: Quux $baz)".  Note that this
    version may not be final, and another reformat may likely come, though
    that one would likely just consist of different keywords to replace
    [result, params, update, read] and not other changes; feedback on this
    is welcome.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the 3 core pseudo-types
    sys.Core.Some.(Universal|ScaTupRel|Ordered), and added the 1 core
    remnant type sys.Core.Remnant.ScaTupRel; the new one replaces one of
    the removed, and the other 2 removed are now just redundant with the
    normal Universal and Ordered types.  It seemed rather arbitrary that
    some contexts (like routine signatures) which couldn't actually take
    all combinations of their parameter types would in some cases have said
    parameters documented as pseudo-types, other times as regular types.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Reversing one change made
    for release 0.9.0, a Cat.Name is once again allowed to be the empty
    string (like 'Text', not 'NEText'), and Cat.NameChain parts likewise.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Officially demoted the Order
    type from a generic type to a catalog-specific type, since it isn't
    really ever expected to be used in user data, but just routine
    definitions.  It was renamed from sys.Core.Order.Order to
    sys.Core.Cat.Order, and the definition of the type was moved from the
    generic scalars section to the catalog scalars section; it did not get
    further renamed to 'E_FOO' as Order is still more special than the
    average enum type as per the enum type Bool, if nothing else than for
    directly corresponding to a concept in multiple other programming
    languages such as Perl 6.  In Core.pod, added new main pod section
    SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE CATALOG FUNCTIONS and moved the Order routines
    there, renaming each of them from Order.foo to Cat.Order_foo in the
    process.  In Grammar.pod, renamed the 'order' token to 'cat_order' and
    moved it next to the existing catalog types; made other appropriate
    updates there, and updates and moves in PerlHosted.pod.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated any routine signatures that specified some
    collection-type parameters as Foo{Bar} so they spell it FooAsBar
    instead.  Also added a few explicitly system-defined Spec.FooOfBar that
    didn't previously exist but were referred to by said routines.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the 3 scalar types Spec.PInt(1_4|2_(N|36)) to
    Cat.PInt(1_4|2_(N|36)), moved to catalog types.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed (from 'Spec') or added the following 9
    quasi-catalog incomplete types, which are used only as the declared
    types of some system-defined N-ary relational operators; all are in the
    new package 'sys.Core.QuasiCat': (Set|Bag)Of(Tuple|Relation), SetOfBag,
    MaybeOfTuple, SeqOfSeq, QuasiSetOf(Tuple|Relation).  Moved to a new doc
    section SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE QUASI-CATALOG PARAMETERIZED TYPES.

    * (Core.pod)  With the above 2 groups removed from 'Spec', that package
    is now simply for conveniently system-defined collection-of-scalar
    types that are likely to be used in user data, and many of which are
    the declared types of N-ary system-defined scalar operators.  Added any
    of the following 32 subtypes that didn't previously exist:
    sys.Core.Spec.(Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag)Of(Scalar|Ordered),
    sys.Core.Spec.(Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag)Of(Bool|Int|UInt|Rat|Blob|Text).

    * Brought the TODO file in line with recent progress, replacing the few
    broad-scope line items with more detail-scope ones, added some
    speculation items.

    * Incremented all copyright year range-ends to 2008.

    * (Core.pod)  Other minor updates.

2007-12-31   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.15.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.15.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.15.0 and Core.pod 0.13.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.10.3.  The other pre-existing versioned files are
    unchanged.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the type sys.Core.Int.PInt2_N to
    sys.Core.Spec.PInt2_N and moved its declaration downwards.

    * (Core.pod)  Generally speaking, Muldis D now requires that for any
    defined relation type, there is a corresponding (same heading) tuple
    type also defined; the reverse is not true, though.  To be specific,
    any relation type is defined over the type that its tuples must be; a
    tuple type definition covers the minimal required relational heading.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the 6 tuple type factories
    (|Quasi)(Set|Seq|Bag)Elem, which have the same headings as the 6
    existing relation type factories (|Quasi)(Set|Seq|Bag).

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed Cat.(|SetOf)NameMap to Cat.(|SetOf)NameExprMap,
    and renamed its attributes from 'key','value' to 'name','expr'.  Also,
    as a reversal of one change made for release 0.8.0, renamed
    Cat.BiDiNameMap to Cat.AttrRenameMap, and renamed its attributes from
    'key','value' to 'before','after'.  The latter is therefore no longer a
    subtype of (the first of) the former.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the catalog types so that they can now fully
    define expression trees and functions (except where new data types are
    also required).  Renamed the enumerated type Cat.E_EK to Cat.E_ENK.
    Renamed the tuple type Cat.Expr to Cat.ExprNode, and added a 9th 'tk'
    attribute to it.  Added 6 new tuple|relation catalog types Cat.ExprSet,
    Cat.ExprTree, Cat.InnerFunc, Cat.InnerFuncSet, Cat.InnerFuncTree,
    Cat.Func.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the catalog types so that they can now fully
    define multi-update statements and multi-update operators (as per
    above).  Building on the expr/func stuff, added 6 new tuple|relation
    catalog types Cat.UpdateStmt, Cat.MultiUpdateStmt, Cat.InnerUpdateOper,
    Cat.InnerUpdateOperSet, Cat.InnerUpdateOperTree, Cat.UpdateOper.  Also
    added 2 more values to the Cat.E_ENK type, '(upd|ro)_param', and then
    generalized Cat.Expr so it can be used with subject-to-update
    params/args to define pseudo|virtual-variables.  So the composition of
    an update operator definition is mostly expression nodes like with the
    composition of functions.  Note that presumably the Muldis D provision
    of updateable virtual relvars (aka SQL's "views") would be provided as
    an abstraction over functions and update operators, or some such.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the catalog types so that they can now fully
    define non-atomic statements and procedures (as per above).  Building
    on the expr/func/upd stuff, added 1 new scalar catalog type Cat.E_PSAK
    and 7 new tuple|relation catalog types Cat.ProcStmtArg,
    Cat.ProcStmtArgSet, ProcStmt, Cat.SeqOfProcStmt, InnerProc,
    Cat.InnerProcTree, Cat.Proc.

    * (Core.pod)  Added 8 generic reduction operators
    'sys.Core.(Relation|Set|Seq|Bag).(|maybe_)reduction', so users can more
    easily write their own N-ary reduction operators.

    * (Core.pod)  Added initial complement of 11 Seq-specific functions,
    besides the 2 aforementioned: 'value', 'update_value', 'insertion',
    'deletion', 'is_element', 'is_not_element', 'catenation', 'repeat',
    'reverse', 'is_subseq', 'is_not_subseq'.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Other minor updates.

2007-12-18   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.14.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.14.0.tar.gz.

    * This release coincides with the 20th birthday of Perl; Larry Wall
    released Perl 1 to the public on 1987 December 18th.  Moreover, on this
    20th birthday is the general/stable release of Perl 5.10, its best yet.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.14.0 and Core.pod 0.12.0 and
    Basics.pod 0.10.2 and Grammar.pod 0.7.2 and PerlHosted.pod 0.4.2.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Small updates to the ROUTINES main section.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Added 4 new trivial data
    type definitions 'sys.Core.(|Quasi)(Tuple|Relation).D0', some of which
    were previously referenced but not defined; also corrected any
    references that said 'D0C(0|1)' to just say'D0'.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new pseudo-type sys.Core.Some.ScaTupRel, which is
    essentially a union type over Scalar|Tuple|Relation; it is for tersely
    refering to the general type of a scalar|tuple|relation attribute.

    * (Core.pod)  Added 3 new Int functions, 'increase' and 'decrease'
    (meaning '++' and '--'), and 'factorial'.

    * (Core.pod)  Added 2 new Tuple functions 'attr_from_Tuple' and
    'Tuple_from_attr', which work with degree-one tuples; they are
    analagous to the 2 "(T|R) from (R|T)" Relation functions that work with
    cardinality-one relations.  Also added 2 new Tuple functions 'attr' and
    'update_attr', which read or write an attribute in an arbitrary tuple.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new Relation function 'power_set', which results in
    a Set of all subsets of its Relation argument (which could itself be
    just a Set).  (Note: Not sure whether or not this is actually useful.)

    * (Core.pod)  Added descriptions to the Relation functions
    group|ungroup, updated those of tuple wrap|unwrap.  Added 3 new
    complementary tuple|relation functions cmpl_wrap|cmpl_group.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the Relation function 'substitution', and
    added 2 new relational functions,
    'substitution_in_(restriction|semijoin)'.  While 'substitution' will
    transform all tuples unconditionally, the 2 new 'in' functions let one
    keep the substitutions within a subset of the tuples.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new Relation function 'map', which provides a
    convenient one-place generalization of per-tuple transformations that
    otherwise might require the chaining of up to a half-dozen other
    operators like restriction, extension, and rename; like Perl's "map",
    or SQL's generic select-list.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the Relation function 'summary', giving it a
    full parameter list and description.  Note that this function is only
    intended to be used in situations where the corresponding SQL would
    involve a GROUP BY, and there is to be one result tuple per group,
    which also means an empty result relation from an empty input relation.
    Those who want their summary to be one tuple for the entire input, even
    an empty one, would just invoke the N-ary / aggregate operators
    directly without doing it by way of 'summary'.

    * (Core.pod)  Added 2 new Relation functions 'is_(|not_)proper_subset'.

    * (Core.pod)  Added initial complement of 6 Set-specific functions:
    'is_member', 'is_not_member', 'insertion', 'deletion', 'Set_from_wrap',
    'Set_from_attr'.  The first 4 are just short-hands for their Relation
    counterparts, having tuple attribute values as parameters rather than
    whole tuples.  The 'Set_from_attr' is intended to be the most
    convenient way to pull out values from an attribute for feeding to an
    aggregate function; it is short-hand for simple relational operations.
    The 'Set_from_wrap' ought to be convenient for other reasons, or if not
    then its counterparts under Bag or Seq perhaps will be.

    * (Core.pod)  Added initial complement of 2 Maybe-specific functions:
    'attr_or_default', 'attr_or_value'.  They are intended to be like
    Perl's defined-or functions, resulting in their only/main argument's
    content if it isn't empty, or a default value / second argument if it
    is; alternately these are like SQL's 2-argument COALESCE or NVL or
    IF_NULL etc; these should be useful in defining outer-joins.

    * (Core.pod)  Added initial complement of 17 Bag-specific functions:
    'is_member', 'is_not_member', 'insertion', 'deletion', 'Bag_from_wrap',
    'Bag_from_attr', 'cardinality', 'is_subset', 'is_not_subset',
    'is_proper_subset', 'is_not_proper_subset', 'union', 'intersection',
    'difference', 'count', 'Set_from_Bag', 'Bag_from_Set'.  The first 6 are
    as per the 6 set-specific functions.  The next 8 are as per the
    same-named Relation functions but that they have special semantics that
    take > 1 multiplicity of values into account; the Relation ones work as
    is for Set, but not as typically desired for Bag.  Then 'count' says
    how many occurrances (which may be zero) of a value are in a Bag.  The
    last 2 are short-hands for moving data between Set and Bag types.

    * (Core.pod)  Other minor updates.

2007-12-09   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.13.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.13.0.tar.gz.

    * As of this release, the in-code $VERSION declarations of all Perl 5
    packages in this distribution are changed to match the X.Y.Z format
    that the same packages' own VERSION POD had all along (the old in-code
    format was X.00Y00Z).  A consequence of this change is that this
    distribution has gained an external dependency on the Perl 5 module
    'version', which is not bundled with Perl 5.8.x; however, it *is*
    bundled with Perl 5.10.x, so if you are using that newer Perl, you
    won't have to install 'version' separately from CPAN.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.13.0 and Core.pod 0.11.0.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed some tuple|relation functions so they describe
    the function's result rather than its action, or are otherwise more
    improved; that is, they are less verbs and more nouns or adjectives:
    'exists' => 'is_member', 'insert' => 'insertion', 'delete' =>
    'deletion', 'evacuate' => 'empty', 'project' => 'projection', 'remove'
    => 'cmpl_projection', 'tclose' => 'transitive_closure', 'restrict' =>
    'restriction', 'extend' => 'extension', 'summarize' => 'summary',
    'substitute' => 'substitution', 'compose' => 'composition'.  Also
    renamed the enumerated value Cat.E_TDM:restrict to
    Cat.E_TDM:restriction.  Also added 2 new complementary functions
    sys.Core.Relation.(is_not_member|cmpl_restriction), and added
    sys.Core.Relation.universal to go with sys.Core.Relation.empty.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed some blob|text functions: 'catenate' =>
    'catenation', 'fold_case_to_(upper|lower)' =>
    'case_folded_to_(upper|lower)', 'trim_whitespace' =>
    'whitespace_trimmed'.  Also renamed some ordered functions:
    '(|reverse_)compare' => '(|reverse_)comparison'.

2007-11-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.12.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.12.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.12.0 and Basics.pod 0.10.1 and
    Core.pod 0.10.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new core functions Ordered.is_(in|out)side_range,
    which provide generic range checking for any Ordered subtype.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the 2 functions (Blob|Text).contains each to
    .is_substr, and renamed Relation.contains to .is_subset; also added 3
    new functions that are 'is_not' variants of the first 3.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new enumerated type Cat.E_RM (rounding
    method), and then merged the 5 old specialized functions
    Rat.round_(half_up|to_(even|floor|ceiling|zero)) into the 1 new generic
    function Rat.Int_from_Rat, whose second parameter is of the new type;
    also renamed Rat.rebase to Rat.round.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new ternary tuple type Cat.RatRoundRule which
    defines a controlled coercion of a real number into a rational number
    having a specific radix and precision.  (Also added new type
    Int.PInt2_N, an integer > 1, which supports it.)  Then refactored the 4
    functions Rat.(round|log|natural_(power|log)) to have 1 parameter of
    the new tuple type rather than 3 round-guiding parameters.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Small typo fixes.

2007-11-19   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.11.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.11.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.11.0 and Basics.pod 0.10.0.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated multiple sections to indicate express support
    for multi-threading within Muldis D virtual machines, where the
    transaction trees of the in-DBMS processes are mutually autonomous, but
    synchronized by the DBMS when they use the same depots.  Updated
    sections were mainly ENVIRONMENT, and TRANSACTIONS AND CONCURRENCY, and
    RESOURCE MODULARITY AND PERSISTENCE, and ENTITY NAMES.  The top level
    entity namespace 'fed' is now specifically the depot mounts by a single
    in-DBMS process, not all depot mounts in the whole DBMS.

2007-11-08   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.10.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.10.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm 0.10.0 and Core.pod 0.9.2 and
    Basics.pod 0.9.0 and Grammar.pod 0.7.1 and PerlHosted.pod 0.4.1.  The
    other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm)  Updated the DESCRIPTION to mention Muldis D in
    retrospect having some designs in common with FoxPro or xBase.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added a TERMINOLOGY item for "universal" to specify
    that Muldis D does not allow sets to be members of themselves, and more
    generally that no type or value definitions may be recursive; so
    "universal" is only the common superset of sets that these rules allow;
    some philosophers may say that it is possible for sets to have
    themselves as members, so this update specifies that Muldis D does not.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the 'main' routine kind to specify that it can
    not see or update any global variables, which now leaves
    '(|inner_)procedure' as the only kind that can; also that 'main' should
    just be loading/invoking depots, where all other user-defined code is.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added new RESOURCE MODULARITY AND PERSISTENCE main
    section.  Removed the whole concept of user-defined entities being
    allowed to exist outside of depots; now all user-defined entities must
    exist in depots.  Also, the conceptual role of depots has been expanded
    to cover general user code libraries, and are not mainly just for data.
    Also, all user-defined relvars|types|invokable-routines now live in
    packages, rather than users having the choice for them to be in or out;
    but package members can also be public, so no actual choice is lost.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated ENTITY NAMES; removed the 'app' top namespace.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated ENTITY NAMES to add the 'imp' top level
    namespace, which is like 'sys' in purpose but that while 'sys' is just
    for types and routines that are defined by the standard Muldis D
    specification, 'imp' is for other, non-standard types and routines that
    a Muldis D implementation has added, and which are specific to that
    implementation.  Also added is the new relcon namespace 'cat.impl',
    which is to 'imp' what 'cat.system' is to 'sys'.  It is expected that
    the catalog relvars under cat.(mount|foreign|interp), whose structures
    were already expected to be implementation-specific, would likely need
    to be defined in terms of (typically named nonscalar) data types that
    are also implementation-specific, and so those are invokable under
    'imp'.  Besides that main intended purpose of 'imp', a Muldis D
    implementation that wants to embrace and extend Muldis D with further
    types and routines intended for user data, should declare them there.

    * (Basics.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Updated ENTITY NAMES, and
    other references, to rename the 'glo' (global) top-level entity
    namespace to 'fed' (federation), for better accuracy; likewise, renamed
    the 'sch' (schema) top-level namespace to 'sdp' (subdepot).

    * (Basics.pod)  Fleshed out ENTITY NAMES with new documentation
    subsections that describe the various name spaces, and interpretation.

    * (Core.pod)  Added comment to Relation.Set mentioning that a set type
    is essentially the power set of the type of its 'value' attribute.

2007-10-11   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.9.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.9.1.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm and Core.pod 0.9.1.  The other
    pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Core.pod)  Each main type declaration now had its own level-2
    heading rather than it being a bullet-list item.

    * Fleshed out the tail of this Changes file with a summary pre-release
    (rel. 2007 June) history of Muldis D; going from mid-2002 to mid-2007.

2007-10-09   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.9.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.9.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm and Core.pod 0.9.0 and Basics.pod
    0.8.0 and Grammar.pod 0.7.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.4.0.  The other
    pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Added a paragraph to the
    DESCRIPTION of MuldisD.pm that gives the fully-qualified name of the
    official/original (not embraced and extended) Muldis D language spec
    that this distro represents, and gives instructions for people to
    change at least its authority portion of the name if they release their
    own modifications to the language spec, and instructs for Muldis D code
    to embed the long name of the spec they are written to.  In Grammar.pod
    and PerlHosted.pod, updated their formats for specifying the language
    long name they conform to; in both cases, the root token or PHMD node
    is now a simple sequence of these 4 parts: 'MuldisD', the authority
    string, the version number, and the payload; PerlHosted.pod also gives
    an alternative 3 parts version for up-front VM config, rather than
    repeating it with every payload later.

    * (Basics.pod)  Overhauled what kinds of Muldis D routines there are,
    and consequences thereof; the largest updates were to the ROUTINES
    section.  A hierarchical diagram was added to ROUTINES to group the
    kinds by similarity.  The 3 kinds function|update_operator|procedure
    gained inner_\w+ counterparts, which are the same but soley live within
    and comprise the definitions of other routines, while the initial 3 are
    now strictly not so.  All kinds of constraint routines are now pure
    deterministic functions (that don't see globals), like just the
    type_constraint used to be, which is fine since entire databases are
    defined as being types or variables (so now only procedure|main can see
    globals).  The distinct state_constraint is now gone, merged into
    type_constraint, each of which is tied to a data type definition and
    runs at value selection time.  Now, a transition_constraint is tied to
    a variable and runs when it is updated, it has 2 arguments holding the
    before|after state.  Updated ENTITY NAMES to split the 'lex' namespace
    into itself and 'inn', the latter being used to invoke inner routines,
    and the former being just for true lexicals.  Also updated TRANSACTIONS
    AND CONCURRENCY.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  In Core.pod, added a new SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE
    PROCEDURES section, and its first 2 entries,
    sys.Core.Control.(fail|try_catch), the use of which is now how you
    generally do explicit transactions; appropriate parts of Basics.pod
    were updated to mention/explain this.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the operator sys.Core.Relation.not to
    sys.Core.Relation.negation, for better symmetry with other set ops.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the TYPE SYSTEM section to add a new main type
    category called "remnant types", which is composed of all types that
    don't qualify as a type of the previous 5 categories.  Generally
    speaking, a remnant type is the declared type of each attribute of a
    quasi-nonscalar type, when said attribute isn't one of the special
    system-defined maximal types.  Also added the concepts of "exclusion"
    types and "negation" types to complement the 3 existing concepts of
    union|intersection|difference types.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Renamed the catalog data
    types 'Cat.ShortName' and 'Cat.LongName' to 'Cat.Name' and
    'Cat.NameChain' respectively, and updated their definitions; a Cat.Name
    must now be a non-empty string, Cat.NameChain parts must be likewise,
    and updated the escaping rules for the latter.  In Core.pod, updated
    their documentation, and added 2 more types 'Cat.NESeqOfName' and
    'Cat.FlattenedNameChain' which now are part of the definition of
    'Cat.NameChain'.  In Grammar.pod, updated the grammar concerning entity
    names so they are treated differently than text data; also added
    examples of both to EXAMPLES.  In PerlHosted.pod, added for the first
    time definitions of Cat.Name and Cat.NameChain PHMD nodes, as the new
    section CATALOG SCALAR VALUES; also, "type name" portions of older PHMD
    nodes now can take both payload formats of Cat.NameChain nodes.  Also
    in Core.pod, renamed any other types having 'ShortName' to remove the
    'Short'.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new catalog data type Cat.Type plus new supporting
    types: Cat.E_TK, Cat.E_TDM, Cat.NameTypeMap, Cat.SetOfSetOfName,
    Cat.SetOfNameChain.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new data type 'Cat.Exception' which holds the
    details of a thrown exception, but it lacks a description for now.

    * (Basics.pod)  Removed the CATALOGS main section, and the "Temp Old
    Entity Names Docs" subsection of ENTITY NAMES; these texts were very
    out of date and will be replaced later.

2007-09-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.8.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.8.1.tar.gz.

    * From now on, the file version of MuldisD.pm will be kept in sync with
    the distribution version, regardless of whether that file had otherwise
    been changed since the previous release.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm and Core.pod 0.8.1 and Grammar.pod
    0.6.1 and PerlHosted.pod 0.3.1.  The other pre-existing versioned files
    are unchanged.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Made various minor
    documentation bug-fixes or updates.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE SCALAR FUNCTIONS sections
    for enumerated types to consolidate the per-value selector function
    documentation for brevity; the functions themselves were unchanged.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated all the system-defined function signatures to
    remove the 'RO:' text by parameters; that text was superfluous because
    all parameters of all functions are always read-only.  The 'UPD:' and
    'RO:' text in system-defined procedure signatures remains, since a
    procedure can have either/both subject-to-update or read-only params.

2007-09-22   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.8.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.8.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: Core.pod 0.8.0 and Basics.pod 0.7.0 and
    Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod 0.5.1 and MuldisD.pm 0.5.0 and SeeAlso.pod
    0.3.2 and PerlHosted.pod 0.3.0.  The other pre-existing versioned files
    are unchanged.

    * (MuldisD.pm, Basics.pod)  Updates to various main/introductory
    documentation.  Changed the NAME of Basics.pod to "10,000 Mile View of
    Muldis D" from "Design document of the Muldis D language" as it isn't
    the intro file anymore (MuldisD.pm is instead).  Moved the large
    PREFACE and DESCRIPTION sections from Basics.pod to MuldisD.pm, then
    did a small amount of editing to them; Basics.pod then gained small
    replacements.  Further minor edits to other sections.

    * (Core.pod, PerlHosted.pod, Temporal.pod, Spatial.pod)  More
    system-defined package consolidation: Empty merged into Universal;
    Database merged into Tuple; (Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag) merged into Relation;
    Quasi(Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag) merged into QuasiRelation.

    * (Basics.pod)  Added indenting to the ENTITY NAMES hierarchy.

    * (Core.pod)  Moved the documentation sections about non-catalog
    specialized subtypes below their counterpart sections on catalog types.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed the data types Cat.(ShortNameSet|AttrRenameMap)
    to Cat.(SetOfShortName|BiDiShortNameMap); the latter's attributes were
    also renamed.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the set of catalog data types by adding these
    new ones: Cat.ScalarLiteral, Cat.E_EK, Cat.Expr, Cat.ShortNameMap,
    Cat.SetOfShortNameMap.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Reflected that Muldis DB is now LGPL rather than GPL.

2007-09-11   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.7.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.7.0.tar.gz.

    * Removed the file Catalog.pod, after moving its main content into the
    files Basics.pod and Core.pod, and removed any references to
    Catalog.pod in other files.  The CATALOGS documentation section was
    moved into Basics.pod, below ENTITY NAMES.  The TYPE SUMMARY section
    was merged into its counterpart in Core.pod.  The 2 SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE
    CATALOG (|NON-)SCALAR DATA TYPES sections were moved into Core.pod, at
    the end of all the type definitions.

    * New file versions are: Core.pod 0.7.0 and Basics.pod and Grammar.pod
    0.6.0 and Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod 0.5.0 and PerlHosted.pod 0.2.0.
    The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Chopped the 'main' routine kind down so that it is now
    only applicable to a non-hosted Muldis D application; hosted (eg, by
    Perl) Muldis D programs don't have 'main' Muldis D routines.

    * (Basics.pod, Core.pod)  Changed the database type so its attributes
    may now be composed of not only relations, but databases (the leaves of
    this recursion are all relations); the reason for this was to provide a
    more elegant way to represent the common convention of dividing a
    relational database into schemas for better entity management.

    * (Basics.pod)  Started rewrite of the ENTITY NAMES documentation; for
    now there is just the addition of a new namespace hierarchy.  The new
    hierarchy has the following 8 top-level names: cat, sys, app, glo, dep,
    sch, pkg, lex.  The old namespaces map to the new ones as follows:
    sys.cat -> cat.system ; nat.cat -> cat.native ; mnt -> cat.mount ;
    foreign -> cat.foreign ; interp -> cat.interp ; sys.(type|rtn).* ->
    sys.(Core|<extension>).<package>.* ; nat.(data|type|rtn).* ->
    (app|glo.<depot>).* ; lex.* -> lex.* .  The top-level names [dep, sch,
    pkg] are context-sensitive aliases for something under 'app' and/or
    'glo', so entities can tersely and portably refer to their own
    depot|schema|package, sort of like 'lex' (lexical) allows.  Notably,
    the type of entity, data|type|rtn, is no longer included in the long
    name of most entities, and entities of different types now clearly
    share the same namespace, as per is typical with SQL DBMSs where both
    tables and stored procedures are in the same schema object namespaces.

    * (Core.pod, Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod, Temporal.pod, Spatial.pod)
    Renamed all the system-defined types and operators to roughly fit into
    the new namespace hierarchy.  The operators saw less drastic changes,
    as roughly speaking, their 'rtn' name component was simply changed to
    'Core' (it would have been different for temporal/spatial operators,
    but none of those were defined yet).  The types saw more drastic
    changes; roughly speaking, all 'type' were renamed to one of
    Core|Temporal|Spatial, and for non-catalog core types, the unique part
    of each name was replaced with 2 instances of itself.  Roughly
    speaking, what used to be a type name now doubles as a type name and a
    package name for both that type and for its operators.  Following this,
    the new system-defined packages were then either consolidated or split
    as appropriate, grouping most similar entities and separating less
    similar ones.  For example, all generic 'Int' types were grouped under
    one package, and the 'Temporal' types were split into several.

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Updated the example user-defined
    entity names so that they roughly fit into the new namespace hierarchy.
    What was nat.type.* is now glo.the_db.*.

2007-09-03   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.6.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.6.0.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: Core.pod 0.6.0 and Basics.pod 0.5.1 and
    Grammar.pod 0.5.0 and Temporal.pod 0.4.1 and Spatial.pod 0.4.0 and
    Catalog.pod 0.3.1 and PerlHosted.pod 0.1.0.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Core.pod, Basics.pod, Catalog.pod, Temporal.pod, Spatial.pod)
    Renamed the union type Ordinal to Ordered, and any types previously
    referred to as being ordinal types are now referred to as being ordered
    types.  This change makes things more correct (and less confusing),
    since actual ordinal types are supposed to be both finite and discrete,
    whereas some Muldis D ordered types are infinite and/or continuous.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the floating-point numeric types from the core
    again, but that they aren't yet re-added to some language extension;
    they will be later, as per inexact or significant-figure-watching
    numerics in general.  Now the core just contains exact numerics that
    are integers or rationals (and generally speaking it will now be said
    exact types specifically which some common language extensions like
    temporals or spatials are generally built over).  This simplifying
    change was made because it is expected that most general uses of
    numerics in Muldis D program code will not use numbers in the extreme
    ranges that only inexact floats can represent efficiently (eg, 10^308),
    and rather they will likely just have numbers of less than 20-30
    digits, which are easy enough for rationals.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the Rat|BRat|DRat type definitions slightly.

    * (Core.pod)  Added the URat|PRat types, which are to Rat what
    UInt|PInt are to Int.  Also added (Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag)OfRat types.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new Int operators range|median|mode, updated the
    Int operator 'power', moved the definition of 'abs' upward.

    * (Core.pod)  Added an initial complement of 28 Rat operators, which
    are mostly a superset of analogies to the Int operators (minus
    'remainder'); additions include operators for calculating
    means/averages, logarithms, and rounding.

    * (Grammar.pod, PerlHosted.pod)  Added sections for the Rat|URat|PRat
    types as per for Int|UInt|PInt.

    * (Spatial.pod)  Added an initial hierarchy of 15 spatial types, but
    as yet they lack descriptions.

2007-08-31   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.5.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.5.0.tar.gz.

    * The rational numeric and floating-point numeric data types have been
    promoted to the language core, and so the main content of Num.pod was
    moved into Core.pod, under the TYPE SUMMARY and SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE
    SCALAR DATA TYPES sections; the rest of the file Num.pod was then
    deleted, and any references to it in other files were removed.  The
    promoted data types were also renamed to remove the '.Num'.

    * New file versions are: Basics.pod and Core.pod 0.5.0 and Grammar.pod
    0.4.1.  The other pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Reorganized the entity namespace 'lex.*' so it no
    longer mirrors the structure of the (global) 'nat.*' namespace.  There
    are no longer any lexically scoped data types or routines or special
    catalog variables; only normal variables can be lexical.

    * (Basics.pod)  Updated the definition of the 'function' routine kind
    so it has no lexical variables, consists of a single expression tree,
    and can only invoke functions; hence a function is now just a named
    expression tree.  Replaced the 'host_gate' routine type with the 'main'
    routine type, as it is conceptually the non-invokable "main program" of
    a Muldis D program.

    * (Core.pod)  Added a bunch of named core data subtypes that exist for
    convenience, such as because they name many core operator parameter
    types.  Added a tree of these to the TYPE SUMMARY section, and added a
    new SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE SPECIALIZED SUBTYPES section.  For example,
    many of these additions are named
    'sys.type.(Set|Maybe|Seq|Bag)Of(Bool|Int|Blob|Text)'.  The pre-existing
    'sys.type.PInt2_36' type was also moved into these sections.

    * (Core.pod)  Rearranged the documentation sections for operators, so
    that they are all grouped first by routine kind and second by the
    mainly applicable data type, rather than the reverse grouping; all
    functions appear first (the vast majority), then all update operators
    (a minority), then all system services (a smaller minority.

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed many 'v' function parameters to 'topic'.

    * (Core.pod)  Updated the 2 int-text mapping function signatures to
    rename any 'Text' to 'NEText'.  Merged and generalized the 4 blob-text
    mapping functions into 2 which lack '_(2|16)' suffixes.  Added
    'maybe_*' variants of the 2 functions 'Int.(quotient|remainder)'.

    * (Core.pod)  Removed the 'Rat' subtype 'RatI' and renamed its sibling
    subtypes to '(B|D)Rat' from 'Rat(B|D)'.

    * (Core.pod)  Replaced the 2 'FloatB(32|64)' data types with the more
    generic 'Float' type, then gave that 2 new subtypes of '(B|D)Float' as
    per the 'Rat' type hierarchy.  The new 'Float' type is an exact numeric
    of unlimited precision as per 'Int' and 'Rat', and it doesn't have any
    special values like a +/- zero distinction, nor infinities, nor NaNs.
    Note that all Muldis D core numeric types are exact and lack special
    values; any numerics that are inexact or have special values will be
    relegated to language extensions; in the core, any precision loss that
    could possibly happen in an operation (eg, from a square-root) is part
    of the defintion of operators, not the data type.

    * (Core.pod)  Replaced the function 'Tuple.extend' with
    'Tuple.product'; the latter is also fleshed out.

    * (Core.pod)  Fleshed out the definitions of these functions:
    'Relation.quotient' (also renamed from 'divide'), 'Relation.restrict',
    'Relation.extend'.  Also added these functions: 'Relation.product'.

    * (Grammar.pod)  Changed the tokens 'Cat(Short|Long)Name' to
    'Cat.(Short|Long)Name' so they match actual type names like the rest of
    Grammar.pod does.

2007-08-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.4.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.4.1.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: PerlHosted.pod 0.0.1.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (PerlHosted.pod)  This release is an experiment with an alternate
    formatting of the POD list items, in an attempt to make them look more
    like actual lists under the Search CPAN site, rather than paragraphs;
    each "=item Foo" is now spelled "=item *\rFoo".

2007-08-09   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.4.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.4.0.tar.gz.

    * Renamed MuldisD.pod to MuldisD.pm, and added an empty dummy package
    declaration of Language::MuldisD to it, all for the sole purpose of
    helping the CPAN indexer link to this distribution properly; it doesn't
    work when the namespace file is plain pod.  For similar reasons, the
    version number of MuldisD.pm will now always be kept in sync with the
    whole-distribution version number declared in the Makefile.PL.

    * Also renamed Language.pod to Basics.pod.

    * New file versions are: MuldisD.pm and Basics.pod and Core.pod and
    Grammar.pod and Num.pod and Temporal.pod 0.4.0.  The other pre-existing
    versioned files are unchanged.

    * (Basics.pod)  Introduced complete vs parameterized types.

    * (Basics.pod)  Every data type is now named and is referred to by that
    name, the change being that only scalar types used to have names.  This
    said, the actual identities of types haven't changed, so 2
    differently-named declarations of types that aren't scalar and have the
    same structure will still be considered to be the same actual type; the
    names for types that aren't scalars are simply aliases for this
    identity.  This change was made to greatly simplify (and reduce errors
    in) the process of declaring data types, particularly hierarchical
    types, and declaring nonscalar values.

    * (Core.pod)  Added new operators
    Universal.(is_value_of_type|treat|default).

    * (Core.pod)  Renamed each of the operators Universal.(equal|not_equal)
    and Relation.(empty|not_empty) to prepend an "is_".

    * (Core.pod, Num.pod, Temporal.pod)  Updated each of the ordinal data
    types to specify what their minimum and maximum values are, or whether
    said are infinities.

    * (Core.pod)  Redefined the Maybe-returning N-ary functions
    Ordinal.(min|max) with versions that instead try to return that
    functions' identity value when given zero argument values, and
    fails/dies in just specific situations where said identity is
    impossibly or impractically large to handle.  Also added 2 new
    functions Ordinal.maybe_(min|max) that provide the old behaviour.

    * (Core.pod)  Redefined the N-ary functions Blob.(and|or|xor) from
    resulting in Maybes to resulting in identity values on zero inputs.
    Also corrected the Relation.intersection function definition such that
    its identity value is actually the universal relation for its heading,
    not the empty relation; depending how big that is, the function may now
    possibly fail on zero input values.  Also added new function
    Relation.not, which results in its argument subtracted from the
    universal relation for the same heading; this may possibly fail if that
    is too big a value.

    * (Temporal.pod)  Restricted the Temporal.Duration(|OfDays) types to be
    specific to data with time zone offsets, and added 2 more types
    Temporal.Duration(|OfDays)NoTZ to handle the other possibility; the
    idea is that the former should be considered more accurate than the
    latter, as per DateTime vs DateTimeNoTZ.  Also updated all 4 to permit
    negative durations in addition to positive ones.  Also rearranged the
    types to group all the with-timezone and no-timezone together.

    * (Grammar.pod)  Rewrote the representative Concrete Muldis D grammar
    so that it is formatted as an actual compiling (though otherwise
    untested) Perl 6 grammar, rather than the pseudo-LALR grammar.  Also,
    the rewritten grammar is actually complete, unlike the many "todo" gaps
    in the old.  Not that it won't stand to be further improved later.

    * (Grammar.pod)  Added new EXAMPLES documentation section which shows
    actual Concrete Muldis D code fragments.

    * Added new file lib/Language/MuldisD/PerlHosted.pod, which starts at
    version 0.0.0.  This file parallels Grammar.pod, but instead shows what
    arrangement of core Perl data structures make up Perl hosted Abstract
    Muldis D, which is the recommended interchange format between Muldis D
    implementations and Perl applications.  With code examples!  This file
    also stands as a recommendation for a general AST for use by database
    related modules, such as ORMs, to specify database queries with.

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.3.1 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.3.1.tar.gz.

    * New file versions are: Language.pod and SeeAlso.pod 0.3.1.  The other
    versioned files are unchanged at 0.3.0.

    * Fixed a bug where both MuldisD.pod and Language.pod had the same
    NAME, which resulted in CPAN indexing problems.

    * Minor fix in SeeAlso.pod.

2007-07-24   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.3.0 is released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.3.0.tar.gz.

    * What was Muldis-DB at version 0.2.0 and earlier, has been split in 2,
    with the parts to be Language-MuldisD and Muldis-DB, each at version
    0.3.0 and later.  Prior to the split, both the Perl 5 and Perl 6
    versions of Muldis-DB contained identical copies of what became
    Language-MuldisD; after the split, neither Muldis-D had a copy.

    * All versioned files had their version numbers brought up to 0.3.0.

    * This is the first release of the Language-MuldisD distribution, and
    the first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 modules named
    Language::MuldisD::\w+.

    * The file lib/Language/MuldisD.pod is cloned from part of what used to
    be lib/Muldis/DB.pm, and the file lib/Language/MuldisD/SeeAlso.pod is
    cloned from part of what used to be lib/Muldis/DB/SeeAlso.pod, and
    lib/Language/MuldisD/Language.pod was renamed from
    lib/Muldis/DB/Language.pod, and all other lib/Language/MuldisD/\w+ were
    renamed from lib/Muldis/DB/Language/\w+.

    * Updated Grammar.pod concerning '(Int|Blob):x:y' so that the 'x' is
    now a single character in the same base as the 'y', rather than being a
    possibly multi-character integer in base-10; moreover, the 'x' is now
    equal to the highest value that a character may represent, which in the
    base in question is 1 less than the base number.  So eg, base-2 is now
    specified with an 'x' value of '1', base-10 is a '9', base-16 an 'F',
    etc.  Also, the 'y' part for Int|Blob is no longer quote-delimited.

    * This is the Language-MuldisD-0.3.0 file manifest:

2007-07-20   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.2.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.2.0.tar.gz.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the portions of it that became part of the Language-MuldisD
    distribution following release 0.2.0.

    * New file versions are: DB.pod and Language.pod and Core.pod and
    Catalog.pod and Grammar.pod and SeeAlso.pod 0.2.0.  Unchanged file
    versions are: Num.pod and Temporal.pod and Spatial.pod 0.1.0.

    * Updated the TRANSACTIONS AND CONCURRENCY section of Language.pod in
    regards to how the scope of explicit transactions is specified, and
    where implicit transactions occur.  Also, Muldis D now no longer has
    language for non-scope-attached transactions, and any concept of
    distinct transaction initiation or termination statements will be
    hoisted to the host language (presumably as methods of ::DBMS objects).

    * Updated Core.pod to add the scalar type 'PInt2_36', and to replace
    the pseudo-type 'Any' with the pseudo-type 'Some.Universal', and added
    'Some.Ordinal'.

    * Updated Grammar.pod concerning integer literals; they can be
    represented with any of base-2 thru base-36 now.

    * Updated Grammar.pod and Core.pod concerning enumerated types, such as
    Bool and Order; individual values are now specified using eg
    [Bool:true] rather than [Bool.True], which then makes them more like
    literals of other simple types, and less like data type names.

    * Updated Core.pod to add definitions for the generic operators common
    to all ordinal types: compare, reverse_compare, is_increase,
    is_decrease, min, max.  Added 'reverse' operator for the Order type.
    Added or replaced a bunch of operators for the Int|Blob|Text types.
    Other small changes.

    * Updated Core.pod to add an initial complement of common tuple and
    relation operators (such as project, join, union), perhaps most of
    them.  These are a large part of what makes Muldis D a relational
    language at all.

    * Updated Catalog.pod to add new core data types: Cat.ShortNameSet,
    Cat.AttrRenameMap.

2007-07-11   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.1.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.1.0.tar.gz.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the portions of it that became part of the Language-MuldisD
    distribution following release 0.2.0.

    * This is a major release that focuses on overhauling or defining part
    of the Muldis D meta-model / system catalog, which is essential for
    supporting any user-defined DBMS entities, that is, for doing anything
    remotely useful.  Said overhaul is expected to be staged over 3-4
    consecutive releases, of which the current one is essentially just
    updating documentation; not much code was changed by this release.

    * As of this release, all pod-only files now also have version numbers,
    shown in the VERSION docs by NAME, like code-containing modules do; the
    initial version numbers are all 0.1.0.

    * Muldis D now has 2 representation formats (Concrete Muldis D,
    Abstract Muldis D) rather than 3 (relations, ASTs, strings).

    * Rearranged any relevant docs so that the most important core scalar
    types are now in the order [Bool, Int, Blob, Text] and the relation
    type factory Maybe now appears after Set.

    * Muldis D now has a new scalar data type, "Order", which is an
    enumeration (like "Bool" is) of 3 values: [Increase, Same, Decrease];
    it is the result type of any binary comparison operator that underlies
    the likes of less|greater-than or min|max or sorting operations.

    * Muldis D now has the new scalar types "Cat.ShortName" and
    "Cat.LongName", which replace the also removed "Cat.EntityName" and its
    (as yet unused) system-defined subtypes.

    * Split up Language.pod 6 ways, into itself and
    Language/(Core|Catalog).pod and
    Language/Ext/(Num|Temporal|Spatial).pod.  For the most part, the only
    initial content of the 5 new files are corresponding portions of what
    used to be the SYSTEM-DEFINED DATA TYPES and (actually empty)
    SYSTEM-DEFINED ROUTINES main documentation sections of Language.pod,
    but that the CATALOGS main section was also moved to Catalog.pod;
    Language.pod retained all the other documentation sections that it
    previously had.  (Language.pod retained about 75% of its previous
    content; about 25% was moved out.)

    * Further updated the 5 language files with type definitions, to update
    some definitions, and also to add a small TYPE SUMMARY main doc section
    to each file.

    * Updated Core.pod to add several main doc sections that have an
    initial complement of system-defined routines.  In particular, the
    equal|not_equal|assign routines that all types have are now defined,
    and all the common boolean and integer operators were added, and some
    converter routines such as int-from-text et al, were all added.  Many
    other operator definitions are pending, especially the relational ones.

    * Added new file lib/Muldis/DB/Language/Grammar.pod, which describes
    Concrete Muldis D details that aren't applicable to Abstract Muldis D.

2007-06-29   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.0.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.1.tar.gz.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the portions of it that became part of the Language-MuldisD
    distribution following release 0.2.0.

    * New file versions (not marked though) are: Language.pod 0.0.1.

    * The primary purpose of this release is to re-license the Muldis D
    specification under actual free software licenses, specifically version
    3 of the GPL family of licenses, which the Free Software Foundation
    formally published on 2007 June 29th.  By contrast, the previous Muldis
    D releases were under an expiring proprietary license, with just the
    promise of a free re-license to come.  Accordingly, the file
    LICENSE/GPL was added to this distro, which contains the text of the
    GPL version 3.0.

    * This release also includes a collection of small documentation
    updates and fixes, such as the following:  We now use the official
    typography for the names 'TTM' and 'D' and such.  Added a DOCUMENTATION
    READING ORDER section to the README file.

2007-06-20   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.0.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.0.tar.gz.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to
    the portions of it that became part of the Language-MuldisD
    distribution following release 0.2.0.

    * Initial file versions (not marked though) are: Language.pod 0.0.0.

    * As of this release, the Muldis D specification is officially in
    pre-alpha development status.  A lot of documentation is present, but a
    lot isn't.  What is mostly done is the higher level documentation.
    What is mostly undone is documentation of the API details.  What is
    already present should be sufficient to begin study of Muldis D such
    that it can actually be put to use within the next few weeks or months
    as Muldis D is fleshed out.  Also, it should be possible now to start
    writing code that implements it or uses said.

    * Started rewriting Rosetta again, but with a name change, since
    "Rosetta" was no longer appropriate for various reasons.  This rewrite
    took the intentionally bad and temporary name QDRDBMS, to be renamed
    again (to Muldis DB) later on.  With the name change allowed for the
    previous version numbering of Rosetta to be dropped, and this rewrite
    would eventually be first released as version zero.

    * QDRDBMS was started in the wake of having had a lot more experience
    in reading up on the truly relational model of data, and was now
    designed fundamentally to be the design and implementation of a new
    turing complete programming language for working with relational
    databases, now called "QDRDBMS D".

    * Made an experimental CPAN release of QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 on
    2007-05-31, which specifically was a quick branch that stripped out all
    the code and just contained the documentation.  This was the only CPAN
    release of the (partial) project under the QDRDBMS name.

    * Shortly after this, QDRDBMS was renamed to its presumably final name
    of "Muldis DB", and its command language to "Muldis D".  But while
    "Muldis D" stuck, "Muldis DB" was fated for a further rename later.

2006-04-14 thru 2006-11-22

    * Started a complementary Perl 6 project named "Relation" which was
    intended to provide native tuple and relation data types for ordinary
    use in Perl 6 programs like other built-in collection types.  It is
    now stagnant; it will likely get un-stuck after Muldis Rosetta sets an
    example for it.

2006-02-01 thru 2006-04-13

    * The first simultaneous releases of the Perl 5 and 6 versions of
    Rosetta's rewrite occurred on 2006-02-01; they were also the first CPAN
    releases of either version.  The Perl 6 one was Pugs release 6.2.11
    (SVN rev 8934).

    * On 2006-02-23 was the first (Perl 5) CPAN release of Rosetta where
    the project was then officially an implementation of "The Third
    Manifesto", the central work of Darwen and Date's DBMS proposal;
    moreover, Rosetta's command language was named "Rosetta D", to be a "D"
    language by the terms of said proposal.

    * On 2006-03-20 was the (Perl 5) release that declared Rosetta was to
    be fundamentally a self-contained relational DBMS (and the core
    distribution would bundle such an implementation of its API) rather
    than "just" a DBMS wrapper; though extensions could still chose to
    operate as wrappers over other DBMSs.

    * On 2006-04-13 was the last CPAN release of the Perl 5 Rosetta, and
    Pugs 6.2.12 (SVN rev 10930), on 2006-06-26, had the corresponding Perl
    6 version; Pugs 6.2.13 (SVN rev 11402), on 2006-10-27, had the last
    CPAN release of Perl 6 Rosetta, with trivial Perl 6 only updates.
    After this, Pugs would have a Muldis Rosetta instead.

2005-12-06 thru 2006-01-31

    * Rosetta started to evolve so that its API and design was based on
    relational algebra, which is a lot of smaller generic constructs that
    can easily be arranged into queries; this is in contrast to the
    previous design based around monolithic and unwieldy SQL "select"
    queries.  Generally speaking, there was increasing influence on the
    design by Hugh Darwen's and Chris Date's proposals on how a truly
    relational DBMS should work.  This time period also saw very little
    code, and almost entirely documentation updates.

2005-12-05

    * Darren Duncan is introduced by David Wheeler to the truly relational
    model of data, in a posting on the Bricolage development list in the
    "Re: [6977] New branch for maintenance of Bricolage 1.10.x." thread.

    * David said that Darren's expressed thought, that compound data types
    in table fields was a violation of first normal form, was in fact a
    misconception about the relational model.  David then referenced a
    recent interview with C. J. Date.

    * This set off a chain of events which was the largest paradigm shift
    to ever affect the Rosetta project.  While the continuing goal of
    Rosetta remained largely the same, the way this was to be accomplished
    would become quite different, and the project would gain a new goal, to
    help improve the design of relational DBMSs themselves.

2005-09-30 thru 2005-12-04

    * Started a full rewrite of Rosetta, with the intent of avoiding being
    over-engineered, and cutting corners in the short term so to get
    something useable at all sooner.  The idea was to focus on vertical
    development first, so that at least a subset of features work earlier,
    taking the development strategy of Perl6-Pugs itself as an example;
    this is in contrast to the more horizontal development strategy of the
    first Rosetta implementation.

    * Moreover, this rewrite was being done simultaneously in both Perl 5
    and Perl 6; each language had its own independent but synchronized
    version, with the Perl 6 one intended to be the main future one that
    guided design decisions, and the Perl 5 one intended to be the one
    production-ready first, to be used until Perl 6 itself was production
    ready.  That co-development was maintained afterwards, and happens with
    the Muldis Rosetta core.

2002-11-12 thru 2005-09-28, plus 2006-01-13

    * Developed and released on CPAN the Rosetta DBMS framework, whose
    intended purpose was to provide rigorous portability of database
    schemas and database-using applications between different SQL DBMS
    products.  A lot of design documentation was produced, as well as some
    code and tests, but while a significant amount of executing code was
    produced, no solution emerged that was actually useable for real work;
    what did get produced was also unnecessarily complicated.

    * The very first CPAN release of anything related to Rosetta was on
    2003-01-05, in the form of DBIx::Portable version 0.01, as
    DBIx-Portable-0.01.tar.gz.

    * A Lightning Talk was also given introducing Rosetta at OSCON 2005;
    but it is Muldis Rosetta instead that will fulfill the promises made in
    it.

2002-06-07

    * Started writing self-contained code components that were explicitly
    designed to enable external code that used them to work seamlessly on
    multiple database products.  Some of this work was reused later in the
    Rosetta DBMS framework et al, and hence 2002 is the start of the
    declared copyright date range for Muldis D language specification.
