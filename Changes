                                  Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

20xx-xx-xx

    * Muldis::D version 0.300.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.300000.tar.gz.

    * This release features the rewriting of the Muldis D language spec. To
    be specific, it adds the rewrite mostly in the form of 3 new files
    {Foundation.pod, Plain_Text.pod, Package/System.pod} plus an expansion of
    and significant edit to D.pod.  The superseded old language spec was
    left alone, to be removed or stripped in a dedicated subsequent release.

    * As part of the rewrite, "Muldis D" is now formally a
    meta-specification consisting of 3 primary component specifications,
    which are: "Muldis D Foundation", "Muldis D Plain Text", and "Muldis D
    Standard Library".  These each have their own version number series,
    currently all synchronized at 0.300.0, but subject to move forward
    at their own rates from now on; the version number of the "Muldis D"
    meta-spec is what is used for the CPAN tarballs.

    * The Muldis D specifications and standard library are now released
    under the terms of the Apache License version 2 rather than the GNU
    General Public License (GPL) version 3+.

    * (D.pod) Updated the VERSIONING section such that the Muldis D Plain
    Text language name no longer has a 5th "Script Name" component; the
    information it conveyed is best done externally to the language name.
    Also updated the "Version Number" sub-section to specify the semantic
    versioning that the official Muldis D spec and standard library uses.

    * (D.pod) Refactor and expand and strip the DESCRIPTION section, and
    mostly-rewrite the whole VERSIONING section along with it.

    * Add new file lib/Muldis/D/Foundation.pod which defines the Muldis D
    fundamental architecture, behaviour, and type system; it supersedes
    Outdated/Basics.pod plus a portion of Outdated/Core/*.pod.  Also moved
    into this file's OVERVIEW section some of what used to be in D.pod,
    that is paragraphs on influence from "The Third Manifesto" and others.

    * Add new file lib/Muldis/D/Plain_Text.pod which defines the Muldis D
    concrete syntax for source code; it supersedes Outdated/Dialect/PTMD_STD.pod.
    This file documents the "Script Name" previously removed from D.pod.

    * Except that it doesn't because the external Muldis Content Predicate
    spec now covers this, along with everything that language name used to
    cover, all of which is no longer part of the Muldis D spec.

    * Add new file lib/Muldis/D/Standard_Library.pod which defines the
    Muldis D common core vocabulary for regular users, that is, it's a
    catalogue to a set of Muldis D packages; it supersedes Outdated/Core.pod.

    * Add new file lib/Muldis/D/Package/System.pod which defines the
    Muldis D primary data types and operators; it supersedes
    a majority of Outdated/Core/*.pod.

    * Between the prior release and this one, the programming language
    formerly known as "Perl 6" was renamed to "Raku".  As such, all
    documentation that refers to that language was updated to use its new
    name, and all language that referred to "Perl 5" now simply refers to
    "Perl" because "Perl" now unambiguously means Perl 5.  The only
    exception to these changes is in documentation about history, such as
    all prior entries in this Changes file.

    * Renamed Outdated dialects HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD to HDMD_[Raku|Perl]_STD
    respectively, per the current corresponding language names.

    * Renamed lib/Muldis/D/SeeAlso.pod to lib/Muldis/D/See_Also.pod.

    * (See_Also.pod) Rewrote the description and classification of
    Dataphor, as the old one was severely out of date.  Also moved mention
    of "acmeism" to this file from D.pod.

    * (Outdated/Basics.pod) Updated the NOTES ON TEXT CHARACTER LITERALS
    section to mark the semicolon character as in use, so now there are no
    printable ASCII characters marked there as not being in use.

    * Updated all 3 Outdated/*/*.pod files having pod syntax errors to fix
    those; they were all of the "unterminated C<...>" variety.

    * Make the distro pass the Perl Kwalitee "has_abstract_in_pod" test:
    For every pod file, tweak its NAME section so the abstract
    is on the same line as the package name rather than the next line.

    * Add new file spec/Muldis_Data_Language.md which will supersede
    the otherwise new D.pod and/or other otherwise new files.

    * Add new file README.md which replaces the file README.

    * Add new file "Referrers" to catalog the known human-written public
    mentions, typically unsolicited, of Muldis D or related projects that
    are written by people other than its creator.

    * Removed obsolete files: INSTALL, Makefile.PL, MANIFEST, MANIFEST.SKIP.

    * Updated all documentation to use an updated canonical Muldis Data
    Systems url of https://muldis.com rather than several http:// variants.

    * Incremented all (version 0.300+) copyright year range-ends to 2019.

2015-03-07

    * Muldis::D version 0.200.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.200.1.tar.gz.

    * The main purpose of this release is to simplify the distribution by
    removing all Perl code save for the (also simplified) Makefile.PL.
    Muldis::D was only ever intended to be a pure documentation
    distribution but until now it was also saddled with some legacy cruft
    in the form of a dummy/empty Muldis::D Perl package plus a trivial
    t/*.t in order for the CPAN tool chain or CPAN Testers to not falsely
    claim test failures or other problems with the distribution.  But the
    proper solution is to get rid of this pointless code and unnecessary
    automated testing, which also leads to confusion by readers as to why
    it is there, and then if the modern CPAN has problems with the lack of
    code, we then deal with that in some more appropriate way.

    * Renamed lib/Muldis/D.pm to lib/Muldis/D.pod and stripped the dummy
    Muldis::D Perl package from it; the POD content is unchanged.  As a
    consequential benefit, GitHub now automatically renders the POD for
    that file like with the other POD files.  Deleted
    t/Muldis_D_00_Compile.t and updated INSTALL to remove any mention of a
    'make test' step for installing this distribution.  Simplified the
    Makefile.PL to no longer require any minimal version of Perl.

    * Updated all files using the incorrect terminology "curried", in
    reference to partial function application, to say "primed" instead;
    some types or routines/parameters were renamed as part of this.

    * Purged this distribution's "Changes" file of practically all change
    details for its approximately 23 releases numbered 0.129.1 thru 0.200,
    most of those now just constituting a single bullet-point in total.  If
    you want to see those change descriptions, look either in the version
    control system as of tag "release-0.200" or in the archived
    distribution tarball named Muldis-D-0.200.tar.gz.

    * Muldis::D version 0.129.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.129.1.tar.gz.  This release marked a milestone for Muldis D
    in that, for the first time, the language specification had been
    considered by its author to be fundamentally complete, with all of the
    important details formally specified.  Prior to that milestone, some
    important details were missing, and so it would have been difficult to
    demonstrate what actual Muldis D code looked like, whereas then it was
    considered by its author as feasible to write and understand code for
    any given task.  In retrospect, the language still needed a lot of
    substantial design changes in order to be good enough to fully
    implement, but at that time it was done enough that its author widely
    announced the 0.129.1 "fundamentally complete" release.

    * Purged this distribution's "Changes" file of practically all change
    details for its approximately 147 releases numbered 0.0.0 thru 0.129.0,
    most of those now just constituting a single bullet-point in total.  If
    you want to see those change descriptions, look either in the version
    control system as of tag "release-0.129.0" or in the archived

2007-06-20 thru 2007-07-20

    * On 2007-06-20 was the very first CPAN release, as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.0.tar.gz, of "Muldis DB for Perl 5", version 0.0.0; it
    bundled the very first CPAN release of "Muldis D" the language spec,
    version 0.0.0.  At this time, the entire existing Muldis D language
    spec was contained in the single file "Language.pod", which had the
    name Muldis::DB::Language.

    * 2007-06-29 : Muldis::DB::Language version 0.0.1.

    * 2007-07-11 : Muldis::DB::Language version 0.1.0.

    * On 2007-07-20 was the very last CPAN release, as
    Muldis-DB-0.2.0.tar.gz, of "Muldis DB for Perl 5" that bundled the
    Muldis D language spec, version 0.2.0.  After this time the two would
    be released separately, in their own namespaces.

2006-09-15 thru 2007-06-02

    * Started rewriting Rosetta again, but with a name change, since
    "Rosetta" was no longer appropriate for various reasons.  This rewrite
    took the intentionally bad and temporary name QDRDBMS, to be renamed
    again (to Muldis DB) later on.  With the name change allowed for the
    previous version numbering of Rosetta to be dropped, and this rewrite
    would eventually be first released as version zero.

    * QDRDBMS was started in the wake of having had a lot more experience
    in reading up on the truly relational model of data, and was now
    designed fundamentally to be the design and implementation of a new
    turing complete programming language for working with relational
    databases, now called "QDRDBMS D".

    * Made an experimental CPAN release of QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 on
    2007-05-31, which specifically was a quick branch that stripped out all
    the code and just contained the documentation.  This was the only CPAN
    release of the (partial) project under the QDRDBMS name.

    * Shortly after this, QDRDBMS was renamed to its presumably final name
    of "Muldis DB", and its command language to "Muldis D".  But while
    "Muldis D" stuck, "Muldis DB" was fated for a further rename later.

2006-04-14 thru 2006-11-22

    * Started a complementary Perl 6 project named "Relation" which was
    intended to provide native tuple and relation data types for ordinary
    use in Perl 6 programs like other built-in collection types.  It is
    now stagnant; it will likely get un-stuck after Muldis Rosetta sets an
    example for it.

2006-02-01 thru 2006-04-13

    * The first simultaneous releases of the Perl 5 and 6 versions of
    Rosetta's rewrite occurred on 2006-02-01; they were also the first CPAN
    releases of either version.  The Perl 6 one was Pugs release 6.2.11
    (SVN rev 8934).

    * On 2006-02-23 was the first (Perl 5) CPAN release of Rosetta where
    the project was then officially an implementation of "The Third
    Manifesto", the central work of Darwen and Date's DBMS proposal;
    moreover, Rosetta's command language was named "Rosetta D", to be a "D"
    language by the terms of said proposal.

    * On 2006-03-20 was the (Perl 5) release that declared Rosetta was to
    be fundamentally a self-contained relational DBMS (and the core
    distribution would bundle such an implementation of its API) rather
    than "just" a DBMS wrapper; though extensions could still chose to
    operate as wrappers over other DBMSs.

    * On 2006-04-13 was the last CPAN release of the Perl 5 Rosetta, and
    Pugs 6.2.12 (SVN rev 10930), on 2006-06-26, had the corresponding Perl
    6 version; Pugs 6.2.13 (SVN rev 11402), on 2006-10-27, had the last
    CPAN release of Perl 6 Rosetta, with trivial Perl 6 only updates.
    After this, Pugs would have a Muldis Rosetta instead.

2005-12-06 thru 2006-01-31

    * Rosetta started to evolve so that its API and design was based on
    relational algebra, which is a lot of smaller generic constructs that
    can easily be arranged into queries; this is in contrast to the
    previous design based around monolithic and unwieldy SQL "select"
    queries.  Generally speaking, there was increasing influence on the
    design by Hugh Darwen's and Chris Date's proposals on how a truly
    relational DBMS should work.  This time period also saw very little
    code, and almost entirely documentation updates.

2005-12-05

    * Darren Duncan is introduced by David Wheeler to the truly relational
    model of data, in a posting on the Bricolage development list in the
    "Re: [6977] New branch for maintenance of Bricolage 1.10.x." thread.

    * David said that Darren's expressed thought, that compound data types
    in table fields was a violation of first normal form, was in fact a
    misconception about the relational model.  David then referenced a
    recent interview with C.J. Date.

    * This set off a chain of events which was the largest paradigm shift
    to ever affect the Rosetta project.  While the continuing goal of
    Rosetta remained largely the same, the way this was to be accomplished
    would become quite different, and the project would gain a new goal, to
    help improve the design of relational DBMSs themselves.

2005-09-30 thru 2005-12-04

    * Started a full rewrite of Rosetta, with the intent of avoiding being
    over-engineered, and cutting corners in the short term so to get
    something useable at all sooner.  The idea was to focus on vertical
    development first, so that at least a subset of features work earlier,
    taking the development strategy of Perl6-Pugs itself as an example;
    this is in contrast to the more horizontal development strategy of the
    first Rosetta implementation.

    * Moreover, this rewrite was being done simultaneously in both Perl 5
    and Perl 6; each language had its own independent but synchronized
    version, with the Perl 6 one intended to be the main future one that
    guided design decisions, and the Perl 5 one intended to be the one
    production-ready first, to be used until Perl 6 itself was production
    ready.  That co-development was maintained afterwards, and happens with
    the Muldis Rosetta core.

2002-11-12 thru 2005-09-28, plus 2006-01-13

    * Developed and released on CPAN the Rosetta DBMS framework, whose
    intended purpose was to provide rigorous portability of database
    schemas and database-using applications between different SQL DBMS
    products.  A lot of design documentation was produced, as well as some
    code and tests, but while a significant amount of executing code was
    produced, no solution emerged that was actually useable for real work;
    what did get produced was also unnecessarily complicated.

    * The very first CPAN release of anything related to Rosetta was on
    2003-01-05, in the form of DBIx::Portable version 0.01, as
    DBIx-Portable-0.01.tar.gz.

    * A Lightning Talk was also given introducing Rosetta at OSCON 2005;
    but it is Muldis Rosetta instead that will fulfill the promises made in
    it.

2002-06-07

    * Started writing self-contained code components that were explicitly
    designed to enable external code that used them to work seamlessly on
    multiple database products.  Some of this work was reused later in the
    Rosetta DBMS framework et al, and hence 2002 is the start of the
    declared copyright date range for Muldis D language specification.
