=head1 NAME

Muldis::D::Standard_Library - Muldis D common core vocabulary for regular users

=head1 VERSION

This document is Muldis::D::Standard_Library version 0.300.0.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document is the human readable authoritative formal specification of
the B<Muldis D Standard Library> (B<MDSL>) primary component of the B<Muldis D>
language.  The fully-qualified name of this document and the specification
it contains is C<Muldis_D_Standard_Library https://muldis.com 0.300.0>.

See also L<Muldis::D> to read the B<Muldis D> language meta-specification.

The B<Muldis D Standard Library> specification comprises a documented
library written entirely in Muldis D which provides its common core
vocabulary, the system-defined data types and operators that regular users
of the language would employ directly in their applications and schemas.
It corresponds to the "standard library" that is intrinsic to or bundled
with typical general purpose application programming languages or SQL
DBMSs.  It is the bulk portion of Muldis D that is self-hosted and can be
shared by all Muldis D implementations, though the latter can choose to
internally substitute behaviour-maintaining host-native versions for
performance.  It comprises a set of Muldis D I<packages> (compilation
units) that users can choose from as dependencies of their applications and
schemas.  None are mandatory, and users can choose alternatives, but they
are recommended as the default options for their functionality.
