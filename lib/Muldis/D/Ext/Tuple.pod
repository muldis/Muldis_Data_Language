=head1 NAME

Muldis::D::Ext::Tuple -
Muldis D extension adding more generic tuple operators

=head1 VERSION

This document is Muldis::D::Ext::Tuple version 0.51.0.

=head1 PREFACE

This document is part of the Muldis D language specification, whose root
document is L<Muldis::D>; you should read that root document
before you read this one, which provides subservient details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Muldis D has a mandatory core set of system-defined (eternally available)
entities, which is referred to as the I<Muldis D core> or the I<core>; they
are the minimal entities that all Muldis D implementations need to provide;
they are mutually self-describing and are used to bootstrap the language;
any entities outside the core, called I<Muldis D extensions>, are
non-mandatory and are defined in terms of the core or each other, but the
reverse isn't true.

This current C<Tuple> document describes the system-defined I<Muldis D
Tuple Extension>, which consists of extra operators for generic tuples,
adding to the minimum few defined in the language core.

This current document does not describe the polymorphic operators that all
types, or some types including core types, have defined over them; said
operators are defined once for all types in L<Muldis::D::Core>.

I<This documentation is pending.>

=head1 SYSTEM-DEFINED GENERIC TUPLE-CONCERNING FUNCTIONS

These functions are applicable to mainly tuple types, but are generic
in that they typically work with any tuple types.

=over

=item C<function sys.std.Tuple.degree result NNInt params { topic(Tuple) }>

This function results in the degree of its argument (that is, the count of
attributes it has).

=item C<function sys.std.Tuple.attr_from_Tuple result ScaTupRel params {
topic(Tuple) }>

This function results in the scalar or nonscalar value of the sole
attribute of its argument.  This function will fail if its argument is not
of degree 1.

=item C<function sys.std.Tuple.Tuple_from_attr result Tuple params {
name(Cat.Name), value(ScaTupRel) }>

This function results in the C<Tuple> value which has just one attribute
whose name is given by C<name> and whose value is given by C<value>.

=item C<function sys.std.Tuple.substitution_in_default result Tuple params
{ of(Cat.TypeRef), subst(Tuple) }>

This function results in the tuple value that is the default value of the
tuple data type whose name is given in the C<of> argument, but that zero or
more of its attribute values have been substituted by values given in the
C<subst> argument.  This function is a short-hand for
C<sys.std.Core.Tuple.multi_update> on the result of
C<sys.std.Core.Universal.default>.  This function will fail if either
C<default> would fail for the same C<of> argument, or if its result isn't a
tuple type, or if the heading of C<subst> isn't a subset of the heading of
the default.  The purpose of this function is to support greater brevity in
Muldis D coding such that users can define just part of a desired tuple
value and have the remainder filled in from defaults for them; particularly
useful with tuples that conceptually have some optional attributes.
