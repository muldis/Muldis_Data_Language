=head1 NAME

Muldis::D::Core::Types -
Muldis D general purpose data types

=head1 VERSION

This document is Muldis::D::Core::Types version 0.98.0.

=head1 PREFACE

This document is part of the Muldis D language specification, whose root
document is L<Muldis::D>; you should read that root document before
you read this one, which provides subservient details.  Moreover, you
should read the L<Muldis::D::Core> document before this current
document, as that forms its own tree beneath a root document branch.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document contains one or more sections that were moved here from
L<Muldis::D::Core> so that said other document would not be too
large.

=head1 TYPE SUMMARY

Following are all the data types and data type factories described in this
document, arranged in a type graph according to their proper sub|supertype
relationships:

    sys.std.Core.Type.Universal

        sys.std.Core.Type.Empty

        sys.std.Core.Type.Scalar
            sys.std.Core.Type.DHScalar
                sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.OVLScalar

                    # The following are all regular ordered scalar types.

                    sys.std.Core.Type.Bool
                    sys.std.Core.Type.Int
                        sys.std.Core.Type.NNInt
                            sys.std.Core.Type.PInt
                                sys.std.Core.Type.PInt2_N
                    sys.std.Core.Type.Blob
                        sys.std.Core.Type.OctetBlob
                    sys.std.Core.Type.Text
                    sys.std.Core.Type.Rat
                        sys.std.Core.Type.NNRat
                            sys.std.Core.Type.PRat
                    sys.std.Core.Type.Instant
                    sys.std.Core.Type.Duration

        # The following are mostly nonscalar type factories.

        sys.std.Core.Type.Tuple
            sys.std.Core.Type.DHTuple
                sys.std.Core.Type.Database
                sys.std.Core.Type.Interval
                    sys.std.Core.Type.DHInterval

        sys.std.Core.Type.Relation
            sys.std.Core.Type.DHRelation
            sys.std.Core.Type.Set
                sys.std.Core.Type.DHSet
                sys.std.Core.Type.Maybe
                    sys.std.Core.Type.DHMaybe
                    sys.std.Core.Type.Single
                        sys.std.Core.Type.DHSingle
            sys.std.Core.Type.Array
                sys.std.Core.Type.DHArray
            sys.std.Core.Type.Bag
                sys.std.Core.Type.DHBag

        # The following are all reference types.

        sys.std.Core.Type.Reference
            sys.std.Core.Type.External

Note that C<sys.std.Core.Type.Empty> is a proper subtype of all of the
other types in this graph, but every other type has only one immediate
supertype shown, and hence the graph of them is a simple hierarchy.

Similarly, most C<sys.std.Core.Type.Relation> subtypes have at least 2
parent types; the above graph shows one view of their relationships, and
here is another view of those:

    sys.std.Core.Type.Universal

        sys.std.Core.Type.Empty

        # The following are mostly nonscalar type factories.

        sys.std.Core.Type.Relation
            sys.std.Core.Type.DHRelation
                sys.std.Core.Type.DHSet
                    sys.std.Core.Type.DHMaybe
                        sys.std.Core.Type.DHSingle
                sys.std.Core.Type.DHArray
                sys.std.Core.Type.DHBag
            sys.std.Core.Type.Set
                sys.std.Core.Type.Maybe
                    sys.std.Core.Type.Single
            sys.std.Core.Type.Array
            sys.std.Core.Type.Bag

=head1 SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE MAXIMAL AND MINIMAL DATA TYPES

These core data types are special and are the only Muldis D types that are
neither scalar nor nonscalar nor reference types.  They are all
system-defined and it is impossible for users to define more types of this
nature.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Universal

This is an enumeration data type.  The C<Universal> type is the maximal
type of the entire Muldis D type system, and contains every value that can
possibly exist.  Every other (non-aliased) type is implicitly a proper
subtype of C<Universal>, and C<Universal> is implicitly a union type over
all other types.  Its default value is C<Bool:false>.  The cardinality of
this type is infinity.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Empty

This is an enumeration data type.  The C<Empty> type is the minimal type of
the entire Muldis D type system, and is the only type that contains exactly
zero values.  Every other (non-aliased) type is implicitly a proper
supertype of C<Empty> and C<Empty> is implicitly an intersection type over
all other types.  It has no default value.  The cardinality of this type is
zero.

=head1 SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE SCALAR DATA TYPES

These core scalar data types are the most fundamental Muldis D types.
Plain Text Muldis D provides a specific syntax per type to select a value
of every one of these types (or of their super/subtypes), which does not
look like a routine invocation, but rather like a scalar literal in a
typical programming language; details of that syntax are not given here,
but in L<Muldis::D::Dialect::PTMD_STD>.  Hosted Data Muldis D as hosted in
another language will essentially use literals of corresponding host
language types, whatever they use for eg booleans and integers and
character strings, but tagged with extra meta-data if the host language is
more weakly typed or lacks one-to-one type correspondence; see
L<Muldis::D::Dialect::HDMD_Perl6_STD> or
L<Muldis::D::Dialect::HDMD_Perl5_STD> for a Perl 6|5-based example.  These
types, except for C<Scalar> and C<DHScalar>, are all ordered.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Scalar

This is an enumeration data type.  The C<Scalar> type is the maximal type
of all Muldis D scalar types, and contains every scalar value that can
possibly exist.  Every other (non-aliased) scalar type is implicitly a
proper subtype of C<Scalar>, and C<Scalar> is implicitly a union type over
all other scalar types.  Its default value is C<Bool:false>.  The
cardinality of this type is infinity.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.DHScalar

This is an enumeration data type.  C<DHScalar> is a proper subtype of
C<Scalar> where every one of its possreps' attributes is restricted to be
of just certain categories of data types, rather than allowing any data
types at all; related to this restriction, any dh-scalar value is allowed
to be stored in a global/persisting relational database but any other
scalar value may only be used for transient data.  The C<DHScalar> type is
the maximal type of all Muldis D dh-scalar types, and contains every
dh-scalar value that can possibly exist.  Every other (non-aliased)
dh-scalar type is implicitly a proper subtype of C<DHScalar>, and
C<DHScalar> is implicitly a union type over all other dh-scalar types.  Its
default value is C<Bool:false>.  The cardinality of this type is infinity.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Bool

This is a structure data type.  C<Bool> consists of just the 2 values
C<false> and C<true>.  A C<Bool> represents a truth value, and is the
result type of any C<is_identical> or C<is_not_identical> routine; it is
the only essential general-purpose scalar data type of a generic B<D>
language, although not the only essential one in Muldis D.  A C<Bool>
has 2 system-defined possreps, named C<name> and C<int>.  The C<name>
possrep directly matches the conception of the type as consisting of 2
character string values; it consists of 1 C<Name>-typed attribute whose
name is the empty string.  The C<int> possrep consists of 1 C<Int>-typed
attribute whose name is the empty string and whose value must be one of
[C<0>, C<1>]; the 2 values of each possrep correspond in the same order as
they are documented here.  The default and minimum value of C<Bool> is
C<false>; its maximum value is C<true>.  The cardinality of this type is 2.
The C<Bool> type has a default ordering algorithm that corresponds directly
to that of its C<int> possrep attribute; C<false> is ordered before
C<true>.  The C<Bool> type has an implementation hint for less intelligent
Muldis D implementations, that suggests using the C<int> possrep as the
basis for the physical representation.

The value C<Bool:false> is also known as C<false> and I<contradiction> and
C<⊥>.  The value C<Bool:true> is also known as C<true> and I<tautology> and
C<⊤>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Int

This is a structure data type.  An C<Int> is a single exact integral number
of any magnitude.  An C<Int> has 1 system-defined possrep whose name is the
empty string, which has of 1 C<SEString>-typed attribute whose name is the
empty string.  Its default value is zero; its minimum and maximum values
are conceptually infinities and practically impossible.  The cardinality of
this type is infinity; to define a most-generalized finite C<Int> subtype,
you must specify the 2 integer end-points of the inclusive range that all
its values are in.  The C<Int> type has a default ordering algorithm; for 2
distinct C<Int> values, the value closer to negative infinity is ordered
before the value closer to positive infinity.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.NNInt

This is an enumeration data type.  C<NNInt> (non-negative integer) is a
proper subtype of C<Int> where all member values are greater than or equal
to zero.  Its minimum value is zero.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.PInt

This is an enumeration data type.  C<PInt> (positive integer) is a proper
subtype of C<NNInt> where all member values are greater than zero.  Its
default and minimum value is 1.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.PInt2_N

This is an enumeration data type.  C<PInt2_N> is a proper subtype of
C<PInt> where all member values are greater than 1.  Its default and
minimum value is 2.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Blob

This is a structure data type.  A C<Blob> is an undifferentiated string of
bits.  A C<Blob> has 1 system-defined possrep named C<bits> which consists
of 1 C<BString>-typed attribute whose name is the empty string; each
element of C<bits> is either C<0> to represent a low bit or C<1> to
represent a high bit.  A C<Blob> is a simple wrapper for a C<BString> and
all of its other details such as default and minimum and maximum values and
cardinality and default ordering algorithm all correspond directly.  But
C<Blob> is explicitly disjoint from C<BString> due to having a different
intended interpretation.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.OctetBlob

This is an enumeration data type.  C<OctetBlob> is a proper subtype of
C<Blob> where all member values have a length in bits that is an even
multiple of 8 (or is zero).  An C<OctetBlob> adds 1 system-defined possrep
named C<octets> which consists of 1 C<OString>-typed attribute whose name
is the empty string.  The C<octets> and C<bits> possreps correspond as you
might expect, such that each element of the sole attribute of C<octets>
maps to 8 consecutive elements of the sole attribute of C<bits>; with each
8 bits corresponding to an octet, the lowest-element-indexed bit
corresponds to the highest bit of the octet when the latter is encoded as a
standard two's complement binary unsigned integer, and the
highest-element-indeed bit corresponds to the lowest bit of the octet.  The
reason the C<OctetBlob> type is system-defined as distinct from C<Blob> is
for convenience of users since it is likely the vast majority of C<Blob>
values consist of whole octets and users would want to work with them in
those terms.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Text

This is a structure data type.  A C<Text> is a string of Unicode abstract
characters which is formatted as a sequence of Unicode abstract codepoints
in canonical decomposed normal form (NFD).  Two C<Text> will generally
match at the grapheme abstraction level.  Of course, a Muldis D
implementation doesn't actually have to store character data in NFD; but
default matching semantics need to be as if it did.  A C<Text> has 1
system-defined possrep named C<nfd_codes> which consists of 1
C<UCPString>-typed attribute whose name is the empty string; each element
of C<nfd_codes> represents a Unicode standard version 5.1.0 character
abstract codepoint number.  A C<Text> is a simple wrapper for a
C<UCPString> and all of its other details such as default and minimum and
maximum values and cardinality and default ordering algorithm (sorting is
numeric by abstract codepoint number) all correspond directly.  But C<Text>
is explicitly disjoint from C<UCPString> due to having a different intended
interpretation.  In regards to ordering, possibly the standard Unicode
Collation Algorithm (UCA) also works this way, assuming it is totally
ordered, but that's unsure.  I<TODO: Support customization parameters for
default text sorting.>

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Rat

This is a structure data type.  A C<Rat> (scalar) is a single exact
rational number of any magnitude and precision.  It is conceptually a
composite type with 2 main system-defined possreps, called C<ratio> and
C<float>, both of which are defined over several C<Int>.

The C<ratio> possrep consists of 2 attributes: C<numerator> (an C<Int>),
C<denominator> (a C<PInt>); the conceptual value of a C<Rat> is the result
of rational-dividing its C<numerator> by its C<denominator>.  Because in
the general case there are an infinite set of [C<numerator>,C<denominator>]
integer pairs that denote the same rational value, the C<ratio> possrep
carries the normalization constraint that C<numerator> and C<denominator>
must be coprime, that is, they have no common integer factors other than 1.

The C<float> possrep consists of 3 attributes: C<mantissa> (an C<Int>),
C<radix> (a C<PInt2_N>), C<exponent> (an C<Int>); the conceptual value
of a C<Rat> is the result of multiplying its C<mantissa> by the result of
taking its C<radix> to the power of its C<exponent>.  The C<float> possrep
carries the normalization constraint that among all the
[C<mantissa>,C<radix>,C<exponent>] triples which would denote the same
rational value, the only allowed triple is the one having both the C<radix>
with the lowest value (that is closest to or equal to 2) and the
C<exponent> with the highest value (that is closest to positive infinity).
I<Note: this constraint could stand to be rephrased for simplification or
correction, eg if somehow the sets of candidate triples sharing the lowest
radix and sharing the highest exponent have an empty intersection.>

The default value of C<Rat> is zero; its minimum and maximum values are
conceptually infinities and practically impossible.  The cardinality of
this type is infinity; to define a most-generalized finite C<Rat> subtype,
you must specify the greatest magnitude value denominator, plus the 2
integer end-points of the inclusive range of the value numerator; or
alternately you must specify the greatest magnitude value mantissa (the
I<maximum precision> of the number), and specify the greatest magnitude
value radix, plus the 2 integer end-points of the inclusive range of
the value exponent (the I<maximum scale> of the number).  Common subtypes
specify that the normalized radixes of all their values are either 2 or 10;
types such as these will easily map exactly to common human or physical
numeric representations, so they tend to perform better.

The C<Rat> type has a default ordering algorithm which is conceptually the
same as for C<Int>; for 2 distinct C<Rat> values, the value closer to
negative infinity is ordered before the value closer to positive infinity.

The C<Rat> type has an implementation hint for less intelligent Muldis D
implementations, that suggests using the C<float> possrep as the basis for
the physical representation.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.NNRat

This is an enumeration data type.  C<NNRat> (non-negative rational) is a
proper subtype of C<Rat> where all member values are greater than or equal
to zero (that is, the C<numerator>|C<mantissa> is greater than or equal to
zero).  Its minimum value is zero.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.PRat

This is an enumeration data type.  C<PRat> (positive rational) is a
proper subtype of C<NNRat> where all member values are greater than zero
(that is, the C<numerator>|C<mantissa> is greater than zero).  Its default
and minimum value is 1.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Instant

This is a structure data type.  An C<Instant> is a single point in time
which is specified with arbitrary precision in terms of atomic seconds
with fractions.  That is, an C<Instant> is defined as a point on the
canonical continuous timeline of International Atomic Time (TAI; this is a
perfectly linear scale with no discontinuities), specified by a scalar
number of TAI seconds since the TAI epoch, which is exactly midnight at the
start of January 1st of the year 1958 CE.  Put another way, the C<Instant>
type is intended to have exactly the same meaning as the same-named type of
Perl 6 (see L<http://perlcabal.org/syn/S02.html> for details).

An C<Instant> has 1 system-defined possrep named C<tai_instant> which
consists of 1 C<Rat>-typed attribute named C<seconds>.  An C<Instant> is a
simple wrapper for a C<Rat> and all of its other details such as default
and minimum and maximum values and cardinality and default ordering
algorithm all correspond directly.  But C<Instant> is explicitly disjoint
from C<Rat> due to having a different intended interpretation.

The C<Instant> type is intended more for use with system event time-stamps
or sensitive scientific applications and is not necessarily the best choice
for common human-specified temporal artifacts according to various
calendars, since there is no fixed conversion rate between them in the
general case that includes future dates, and also calendar-based artifacts
may be very non-specific; see also the L<Muldis D Temporal
Extension|Muldis::D::Ext::Temporal> for a selection of other temporal data
types defined in terms of calendars.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Duration

This is a structure data type.  A C<Duration> is a single amount of time,
which is specified with arbitrary precision in terms of the same units as
an C<Instant> is structured with.  A C<Duration> is not fixed to any point
in time.  A C<Duration> is the result type of taking the difference between
two C<Instant> values, but it is not defined in terms of said two values.
The C<Duration> type is intended to have exactly the same meaning as the
same-named type of Perl 6, as per C<Instant>.  A C<Duration> has 1
system-defined possrep named C<tai_duration> which consists of 1
C<Rat>-typed attribute named C<seconds>.  A C<Duration> is a simple wrapper
for a C<Rat> in all ways as per C<Instant>.  But C<Duration> is explicitly
disjoint from C<Instant> due to having a different intended interpretation.
The C<Duration> type is intended more for benchmarking or scientific
applications and is not intended for human-specified calendar based
artifacts; again see the I<Muldis D Temporal Extension> for alternatives.

=head1 SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE NONSCALAR DATA TYPES

These core nonscalar data types permit transparent/user-visible
compositions of multiple values into other conceptual values.  For all
nonscalar types, their cardinality is mainly or wholly dependent on the
data types they are composed of.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Tuple

This is a primitive data type.  The C<Tuple> type is the maximal type of
all Muldis D tuple (nonscalar) types, and contains every
tuple value that could possibly exist.  A C<Tuple> is an unordered
heterogeneous collection of 0..N named attributes (the count of attributes
being its I<degree>), where all attribute names are mutually distinct, and
each attribute may be of distinct types; the mapping of a tuple's
attribute names and their declared data types is called the tuple's
I<heading>.  Its default value is the sole tuple value
that has zero attributes.  The cardinality of a I<complete> C<Tuple>
type (if it has no type constraints other than those of its constituent
attribute types) is equal to the product of the N-adic multiplication where
there is an input to that multiplication for each attribute of the
tuple and the value of the input is the cardinality of the declared
type of the attribute; for a C<Tuple> subtype to be finite, all of its
attribute types must be.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.DHTuple

This is an enumeration data type.  C<DHTuple> is a proper subtype of
C<Tuple> where every one of its attributes is restricted to be of just
certain categories of data types, rather than allowing any data types at
all; related to this restriction, any dh-tuple value is allowed to be
stored in a global/persisting relational database but any other tuple value
may only be used for transient data.  The C<DHTuple> type is the maximal
type of all Muldis D dh-tuple (dh-nonscalar) types, and contains every
dh-tuple value that could possibly exist.  Its default value is the same as
that of C<Tuple> and matters of its cardinality are determined likewise.

The only member value of C<DHTuple> that has exactly zero attributes is
also known by the special name C<Tuple:d0> aka C<d0>, which serves as the
default value of the 3 types C<[|DH]Tuple> and C<Database>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Database

This is an enumeration data type.  C<Database> is a proper subtype of
C<DHTuple> where all of its attributes are each of dh-relation types or of
database types (the leaves of this recursion are all dh-relation types); it
is otherwise the same.  The 3 system-defined user-data variables named
C<[fed|dep|sdp].data> are all of "just" the C<Database> type, or are of
its proper subtypes.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Interval

This is an enumeration data type.  An C<Interval> is a C<Tuple>.  It
defines a single I<bounded interval> or I<finite interval> in terms of 2
I<endpoint> values plus an indicator of whether either, both, or none of
the endpoint values are included in the interval.

An C<Interval> has these 4 attributes:

=over

=item C<min|max> - C<Universal>

These are the interval endpoint values; C<min> defines the
I<left|start|from> endpoint and C<max> defines the I<right|end|to>
endpoint.  The endpoint values conceptually must be of the same,
totally-ordered type (typically one of C<Int>, C<Rat>, C<Text>, C<Instant>,
etc), although strictly speaking they may be of any types at all; in the
latter case, to actually make practical use of such intervals, an
C<order-determination> function must explicitly be employed.

=item C<excludes_[min|max]> - C<Bool>

If C<excludes_min> or C<excludes_max> are C<Bool:true>, then C<min> or
C<max> I<is not> considered to be included within the interval,
respectively; otherwise, it I<is> considered to be included within the
interval.  If both endpoints are within the interval (the use case which
Muldis D optimizes its syntax for), the interval is I<closed>; otherwise if
both endpoints are not in the interval, the interval is I<open>.

=back

The C<Interval> type supports empty intervals (which include no values at
all) at least as a matter of simplicity in that it doesn't place any
restrictions on the combination of attribute values an C<Interval> value
may have, such as that C<max> can't be before C<min>.  This liberal design
is also necessary to support the general case where the relative order of
the C<min> and C<max> values is situation-dependent on what
C<order-determination> function is used with the interval; that function
also determines what type's concept of order is being applied, and so it
also determines whether or not a given interval is considered empty or not.
With respect to each compatible C<order-determination> function, an
C<Interval> is considered empty iff at least one of the following is true:
1. Its C<min> is greater than its C<max>.  2. Its C<min> is equal to its
C<max> I<and> at least one of C<excludes_min> or C<excludes_max> is true.
3. Both C<excludes_min> and C<excludes_max> are true I<and> C<min> and
C<max> are consecutive values.  And so, there are many distinct C<Interval>
values that are conceptually empty intervals, and the C<is_identical>
function should not be used to test an C<Interval> for being empty or not.

The default value of C<Interval> represents an empty interval where its
C<min> attribute is C<Bool:true> and its other 3 attributes are
C<Bool:false>.

The C<Interval> type has no support for I<unbounded>/I<infinite> or
I<half-bounded> intervals that is orthogonal to data type.  However, if
there are any types with their own special values to represent infinities,
then those special values can be uded for endpoints of intervals over those
types.  I<As of this writing, no system-defined types have values for
infinities, so only user-defined types would leverage this.>

The C<Interval> type only represents a continuous interval, but a
discontinuous interval may be effectively represented by a set of
C<Interval> values, either a C<relation_from.Interval> or a
C<set_of.Interval>.  See also the L<Muldis::D::Ext::Interval> extension.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.DHInterval

This is an enumeration data type.  C<DHInterval> is a proper subtype of
C<Interval> where every one of its values is also a C<DHTuple>.  In general
practice, all C<Interval> values are C<DHInterval> values, because their
endpoints would all be C<DHScalar> values.  The default value of
C<DHInterval> is the same as that of C<Interval>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Relation

This is a primitive data type.  The C<Relation> type is the maximal type
of all Muldis D relation (nonscalar) types, and contains every
relation value that could possibly exist.  A C<Relation> is
analogous to a set of 0..N tuples where all tuples have the
same heading (the degrees match and all attribute names, and typically
corresponding declared data types, match), but that a C<Relation> data
type still has its own corresponding heading (attribute names and declared
data types) even when it consists of zero tuples.  Its default value
is the sole relation value that has zero tuples and zero
attributes.  The cardinality of a I<complete> C<Relation> type (if it has
no type constraints other than those of its constituent attribute types) is
equal to 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of the I<complete>
C<Tuple> type with the same heading.  A relation data type can also
have (unique) keys each defined over a subset of its attributes, which
constrain its set of values relative to there being no explicit keys, but
having the keys won't turn an infinite relation type into a finite one.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.DHRelation

This is an enumeration data type.  C<DHRelation> is a proper subtype of
C<Relation> where every one of its attributes is restricted to be of just
certain categories of data types, rather than allowing any data types at
all; related to this restriction, any dh-relation value is allowed to be
stored in a global/persisting relational database but any other relation
value may only be used for transient data.  The main difference from its
supertype is that a dh-relation's dh-tuples' headings all have matching
declared data types for corresponding attributes, while with relations they
don't have to.  The C<DHRelation> type is the maximal type of all Muldis D
dh-relation (dh-nonscalar) types, and contains every dh-relation value that
could possibly exist.  Its default value is the same as that of C<Relation>
and matters of its cardinality are determined likewise.

The only member value of C<DHRelation> that has exactly zero attributes and
exactly zero tuples is also known by the special name C<Relation:d0c0> aka
C<d0c0>, which serves as the default value of the 2 types C<[|DH]Relation>.
The only member value of C<DHRelation> that has exactly zero attributes and
exactly one tuple is also known by the special name C<Relation:d0c1> aka
C<d0c1>.  Note that I<The Third Manifesto> also refers to these 2 values by
the special shorthand names I<TABLE_DUM> and I<TABLE_DEE>, respectively.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Set

This is an enumeration data type.  C<Set> is a proper subtype of
C<Relation> that has 1 attribute, and its name is C<value>; it can be of
any declared type.  A C<Set> subtype is normally used by any
system-defined N-adic operators where the order of their argument elements
or result is not significant, and that duplicate values are not
significant.  Its default value has zero tuples.  Note that, for any
given C<Set> subtype, C<Foo>, where its C<value> attribute has a declared
type of C<Bar>, the type C<Foo> can be considered the I<power set> of the
type C<Bar>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.DHSet

This is an enumeration data type.  C<DHSet> is the intersection type of
C<Set> and C<DHRelation>.  The cardinality of this type is infinite.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Maybe

This is an enumeration data type.  C<Maybe> is a proper subtype of C<Set>
where all member values may have at most one element; that is, it is a
unary C<Relation> with a nullary key.  Operators that work specifically
with C<Maybe> subtypes can provide a syntactic shorthand for working with
sparse data; so Muldis D has something which is conceptually close to SQL's
nullable types without actually having 3-valued logic; it would probably be
convenient for code that round-trips SQL by way of Muldis D to use the
C<Maybe> type.  Its default value has zero tuples.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.DHMaybe

This is an enumeration data type.  C<DHMaybe> is the intersection type of
C<Maybe> and C<DHSet>.  The cardinality of this type is infinite.

The only member value of C<DHMaybe> that has exactly zero elements is also
known by the special name C<Maybe:nothing>, aka C<nothing>,
aka I<empty set>, aka C<∅>, which serves as
the default value of the 4 types C<[|DH]Maybe> and C<[|DH]Set>.  The single
C<nothing> value, which is a relation with zero tuples and a single
attribute named C<value>, is Muldis D's answer to the SQL NULL and is
intended to be used for the same purposes; that is, a special marker for
missing or inapplicable information, that does not typically equal any
normal/scalar value; however, in Muldis D, C<nothing> I<is a value>, and it
I<is> equal to itself.  To be more specific, the SQL NULL is very limited
in what it actually can do, and can not be used to say anything other than
"this isn't a normal value", similar to what Perl's "undef" says; if you
want to actually indicate a reason why we don't have a normal value when
more than one reason could possibly apply in the context, then using simply
C<nothing> or SQL's NULL can't do it, and instead you'll have to use other
normal values such as status flags to keep the appropriate metadata.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Single

This is an enumeration data type.  C<Single> is a proper subtype of
C<Maybe> where all member values have exactly 1 element.  Its default
value's only tuple's only attribute has the value C<Bool:false>.  The
C<Single> type consists of all of C<Maybe>'s values except C<nothing>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.DHSingle

This is an enumeration data type.  C<DHSingle> is the intersection type of
C<Single> and C<DHMaybe>.  Subtypes of C<DHSingle> are also used to
implement data-carrying database objects that are conceptually scalars
rather than relations; for example, the current state of a sequence
generator might typically be one.  The cardinality of this type is
infinite.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Array

This is an enumeration data type.  C<Array> is a proper subtype of
C<Relation> that has 2 attributes, and their names are C<index> and
C<value>, where C<index> is a unary primary key and its declared type is a
C<NNInt> subtype (C<value> can be non-unique and of any declared type).  An
C<Array> is considered dense, and all C<index> values in one are numbered
consecutively from 0 to 1 less than the count of tuples, like array
indices in typical programming languages.  An C<Array> subtype is normally
used by any system-defined N-adic operators where the order of their
argument elements or result is significant (and duplicate values are
significant); specifically, C<index> defines an explicit ordering for
C<value>.  Its default value has zero tuples.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.DHArray

This is an enumeration data type.  C<DHArray> is the intersection type of
C<Array> and C<DHRelation>.  The cardinality of this type is infinite.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Bag

This is an enumeration data type.  C<Bag> (or I<multiset>) is a
proper subtype of C<Relation> that has 2 attributes, and their names are
C<value> and C<count>, where C<value> is a unary primary key (that can have
any declared type) and C<count> is a C<PInt> subtype.  A C<Bag> subtype is
normally used by any system-defined N-adic operators where the order of
their argument elements or result is not significant, but that duplicate
values are significant; specifically, C<count> defines an explicit count of
occurrences for C<value>, also known as that value's I<multiplicity>.  Its
default value has zero tuples.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.DHBag

This is an enumeration data type.  C<DHBag> is the intersection type of
C<Bag> and C<DHRelation>.  The cardinality of this type is infinite.

=head1 SYSTEM-DEFINED REFERENCE TYPES

These are the core reference data types.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Reference

This is an enumeration data type.  The C<Reference> type is the maximal
type of all Muldis D reference types.  Its default value is a reference to
the C<sys.std.Core.Type.Universal> data type by way of its C<MaterialRef>
subtype.  The cardinality of this type is infinity.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.External

This is a reference data type.  An C<External> is a reference within the
Muldis D virtual machine to a value managed not by the Muldis D
implementation but rather by a peer or host language in the wider program
that includes the VM.  All C<External> values are treated as black boxes by
Muldis D itself.  The default value of this type is implementation-defined.
