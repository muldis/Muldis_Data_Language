=head1 NAME

Muldis::D::Core::Universal -
Muldis D general purpose routines

=head1 VERSION

This document is Muldis::D::Core::Universal version 0.100.0.

=head1 PREFACE

This document is part of the Muldis D language specification, whose root
document is L<Muldis::D>; you should read that root document before
you read this one, which provides subservient details.  Moreover, you
should read the L<Muldis::D::Core> document before this current
document, as that forms its own tree beneath a root document branch.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document contains one or more sections that were moved here from
L<Muldis::D::Core> so that said other document would not be too large.

=head1 SYSTEM-DEFINED GENERIC UNIVERSAL FUNCTIONS

These functions are applicable to values of any data type at all.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Universal.is_identical

C<< function sys.std.Core.Universal.is_identical (Bool <--
$topic : Universal, $other : Universal) >>

This symmetric function results in C<Bool:true> iff its 2
arguments are exactly the same value, and C<Bool:false> otherwise.  This
function will warn if, in regards to the declared types of its arguments,
none of the following are true: 1. they are both subtypes of a common
scalar root type; 2. they are both subtypes of a common complete tuple
or relation type, that is they essentially have the same headings; 3. at
least one type is a generic (eg-C<Universal>) or incomplete
(eg-C<Relation>) type, and it is a supertype of the other.  Note that
this operation is also known as I<is equal> or C<=>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Universal.is_not_identical

C<< function sys.std.Core.Universal.is_not_identical (Bool <--
$topic : Universal, $other : Universal) >>

This symmetric function is exactly the same as
C<sys.std.Core.Universal.is_identical> except that it results in the
opposite boolean value when given the same arguments.  Note that this
operation is also known as I<is not equal> or C<≠> or C<!=>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Universal.is_value_of_type

C<< function sys.std.Core.Universal.is_value_of_type (Bool <--
$topic : Universal, $type : TypeRef) >>

This function results in C<Bool:true> iff the value of its C<topic>
argument is a member of the data type whose name is given in the C<type>
argument, and C<Bool:false> otherwise.  As trivial cases, this function
always results in C<Bool:true> if the named type is C<Universal>, and
C<Bool:false> if it is C<Empty>.  This function will fail if the named type
doesn't exist in the virtual machine.  Note that this operation is also
known as C<isa>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Universal.is_not_value_of_type

C<< function sys.std.Core.Universal.is_not_value_of_type (Bool <--
$topic : Universal, $type : TypeRef) >>

This function is exactly the same as
C<sys.std.Core.Universal.is_value_of_type> except that it results in the
opposite boolean value when given the same arguments.  Note that this
operation is also known as C<!isa> or C<not-isa>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Universal.treated

C<< function sys.std.Core.Universal.treated (Universal <--
$topic : Universal, $as : TypeRef) >>

This function results in the value of its C<topic> argument, but that the
declared type of the result is the not-C<Empty> data type whose name is
given in the C<as> argument.  This function will fail if the named type
doesn't exist in the virtual machine, or if C<topic> isn't a member of the
named type.  The purpose of C<treated> is to permit taking values from a
context having a more generic declared type, and using them in a context
having a more specific declared type; such an action would otherwise be
blocked at compile time due to a type-mismatch error; C<treated> causes the
type-mismatch validation, and possible failure, to happen at runtime
instead, on the actual value rather than declared value.  For example, if
you are storing an C<Int> value in a C<Scalar>-typed variable, using
C<treated> will cause the compiler to let you use that variable as an
argument to C<sys.std.Integer.diff>, which it otherwise wouldn't.  Note
that this operation is also known as C<as>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Universal.default

C<< function sys.std.Core.Universal.default (Universal <-- $of : TypeRef)
>>

This function is the externalization of a not-C<Empty> data type's I<type
default> C<named-value> function.  This function results in the default
value of the not-C<Empty> data type whose name is given in the C<of>
argument, and the declared type of the result is that same type.  This
function will fail if the named type doesn't exist in the virtual machine,
either at compile or runtime depending whether the type is in the system or
user namespace. This function is conceptually implicitly used to provide
default values for variables, so they always hold valid values of their
declared type.  Note that this operation is also known as C<d>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Universal.assertion

C<< function sys.std.Core.Universal.assertion (Universal <--
$is_true : Bool, $result : Universal) >>

This function results in the value of its C<result> argument, when its
C<is_true> argument is C<Bool:true>.  This function will fail if its
C<is_true> argument is C<Bool:false>.  The purpose of C<assertion> is to
perform condition assertions in a pure functional context that may be
better done without the overhead of creating a new constrained data type,
especially when the assertion is on some fact that is only known after
performing calculations from multiple function arguments; this can
potentially be done at compile time as per type constraints.  Note that
this operation is also known as C<asserting>.

=head1 SYSTEM-DEFINED GENERIC UNIVERSAL UPDATERS

These update operators are applicable to values of any data type at all.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Universal.assign

C<updater sys.std.Core.Universal.assign (&$target : Universal,
$v : Universal)>

This update operator will update the variable supplied as its C<target>
argument so that it holds the value supplied as its C<v> argument.  This
updater will fail if C<v> isn't of the declared type of the variable behind
C<target>; this function will otherwise warn if the declared type of C<v>
isn't a subtype of the declared type of the variable behind C<target>.
