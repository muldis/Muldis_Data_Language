=head1 NAME

Muldis::D::Core::Types_Catalog -
Muldis D catalog-defining data types

=head1 VERSION

This document is Muldis::D::Core::Types_Catalog version 0.23.0.

=head1 PREFACE

This document is part of the Muldis D language specification, whose root
document is L<Muldis::D>; you should read that root document before
you read this one, which provides subservient details.  Moreover, you
should read the L<Muldis::D::Core> document before this current
document, as that forms its own tree beneath a root document branch.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document contains one or more sections that were moved here from
L<Muldis::D::Core> so that that other document would not be too
large.

These core data types are more special-purpose in nature and are intended
for use in defining or working with the system catalog.  Those types that
are nonscalar are completely defined types.

Note that whenever an attribute of one of the tuple types isn't
significant, given the context (determined by other attributes of the same
type), and should be ignored, its value is the default for its type.

Note that many of the tuple types might conceptually have C<name>
attributes, but those would actually be provided by any larger types in
which they are embedded, rather than by these types themselves.

I<To keep things simpler for now, most constraint definitions for these
types are missing, or just defined informally.>

These system-defined subtypes are used as the declared types of some
parameters of some system-defined N-ary routines, but they are not used in
defining the system catalog itself; it is not anticipated that they would
be used for user data:

=head1 TYPES FOR DEFINING ENTITY NAMES AND COMMENTS

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.Name

A C<Cat.Name> (scalar) is a canonical short name for any kind of DBMS
entity (or named component) when declaring it; this short name is
sufficient to identify the entity within its immediate namespace.
Similarly, a DBMS entity can often be invoked or referred to using just its
C<Cat.Name>, depending on the context; other times, a C<Cat.NameChain> must
be used instead to also qualify the reference with a namespace.
C<Cat.Name> is the same as C<Text> in representation (each value as a
string of characters) and cardinality though its values are distinct; it is
specifically intended for use in naming DBMS entities rather than being for
general-purpose user data.  The default value et al is as for C<Text>.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.NameChain

A C<Cat.NameChain> (scalar) is a canonical long name for invoking or
referring to a DBMS entity, when its name needs to be qualified with a
namespace.  A C<Cat.NameChain> is conceptually a sequence of 2..N
C<Cat.Name>, the 2..N elements being ordered from parent-most to child-most
component name.  A C<Cat.NameChain> has 2 system-defined possreps, named
C<seq> and C<flat>, both of which are defined over C<Cat.Name>.

The C<seq> possrep directly matches the conception of the type; it consists
of 1 attribute whose name is the empty string; the attribute is a C<Seq>
whose C<value> attribute has a declared type of C<Cat.Name> and that must
have at least 2 elements.

The C<flat> possrep consists of 1 attribute whose name is the empty string;
the attribute is a C<Cat.Name>, its value being identical to when the
elements of the first possrep are catenated (in order with the first
element at the start of the string), with a period (C<.>) between the
parts, and each part escaped such that backslashes, single-quotes, and
periods are escaped as C<\b>, C<\q> and C<\p> respectively.

The default and minimum value of C<Cat.NameChain> is a 2 element sequence
where each element is the default value of C<Cat.Name> (the empty string);
its maximum value is an infinite sequence where each element is the maximum
value of C<Cat.Name> (an infinite-length string) and practically
impossible.  The cardinality of this type is infinity; to define a
most-generalized finite C<Cat.NameChain> subtype, you must specify a
maximum number of sequence elements of its values, and each element must be
of a finite C<Cat.Name> subtype.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.DeclNameChain

A C<Cat.DeclNameChain> (scalar) is mostly the same as a C<Cat.NameChain>
but that it is a sequence of 0..N rather than 2..N, and that its C<flat>
possrep has N+1 periods rather than N-1; the possrep starts with a period,
and also has a period just following each sequence element, and so an empty
sequence means a C<flat> possrep consisting of just a period.  A
C<Cat.DeclNameChain> is used in declaring system catalogs where DBMS
entities live under a potentially N-depth namespace, such as depot entities
grouped in a subdepot hierarchy.  The default and minimum value of
C<Cat.DeclNameChain> is a zero element sequence.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.Comment

A C<Cat.Comment> (scalar) is the text of a Muldis D code comment, which
programmers can populate as an attribute of several catalog data types,
such as whole routines or statements or expression nodes.  C<Cat.Comment>
is exactly the same as C<Cat.Name> in representation and cardinality though
its values are distinct; it is intended just for commenting Muldis D code.
One main intended use of this type is to help preserve comments in code
translated to or from other languages; though only a subset of those
(FoxPro?) keep comments in the AST rather than discarding them.  The
default value et al is as for C<Cat.Name>.

=head1 TYPES FOR DEFINING SYSTEM-DEFINED ENTITIES

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.System

A C<Cat.System> is a C<Tuple>.  It specifies the public interfaces of
system-defined entities, specifically all the system-defined types,
routines, and catalogs.  Both standard system-defined entities and
implementation-specific system-defined entities are specified here,
specifically all the relcons and relvars with the names
C<(sys|mnt|fed|dep|sdp|pkg).cat>.  The system catalog constant named
C<sys.cat> is of the C<Cat.System> type.

A C<Cat.System> has these N attributes:

This is an optional programmer comment about the collection of
system-defined entities as a whole.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.SysNspSet

A C<Cat.SysNspSet> is a C<Relation> that specifies the set of system
namespaces that exist for organizing DBMS public entities, mostly the
system-defined ones; these system namespaces are organized into a tree
whose root has no name.  A C<Cat.SysNspSet> only specifies that a system
namespace exists, not which public entities it contains; see the
C<Cat.System> which contains it for that.

=over

=item C<parent> - I<TODO.>

I<TODO.>

=item C<name> - C<Cat.Name>

plus C<name> attributes.  Its default value is empty.

=head1 TYPES FOR DEFINING MOUNT CONTROLS

I<TODO.>

=head1 TYPES FOR DEFINING FEDERATIONS

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.Federation

A C<Cat.Federation> is a C<Tuple>.  It specifies a federation of depot
mounts, that is, all the depot mounts that an in-DBMS process can see or
update, and that defines the scope of an active transaction.  There is
exactly one of these per process and it doesn't have a name.  The system
catalog variable named C<fed.cat> is of the C<Cat.Federation> type.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.DepotMountSet

A C<Cat.DepotMountSet> is a C<Relation> that specifies a set of depot
mounts, such that each tuple is a single depot mount.  A depot mount is a
named in-DBMS context by which a depot is referenced from either other
depots or by the main application, and it also specifies the catalog
content of the depot itself.

A C<Cat.DepotMountSet> has these 3 attributes:

=over

=item C<name> - C<Cat.Name>

This is the declared name of the depot mount; other Muldis D code would
reference it with this name.

A C<Cat.Depot> is a C<Tuple>.  It specifies the entire system catalog of a
single depot, that is, the widest scope within which all entities must be
fully defined in terms of just user-defined entities within the same scope
or of system-defined entities.  It also doubles to specify the system
catalog of a subdepot, which is an arbitrary subset of a depot's entities
that internally looks like a depot; a depot can have 0..N subdepots, and
any that exist are arranged in a hierarchy with the depot as the root.  The
system catalog variables named C<dep.cat> and C<sdp.cat> are both of the
C<Cat.Depot> type.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.SubdepotSet

A C<Cat.SubdepotSet> is a C<Relation> that specifies the set of subdepots
that a depot might optionally have for organizing its public entities;
these subdepots are organized into a tree whose root is the depot.  A
C<Cat.SubdepotSet> only specifies that a subdepot exists, not which depot
entities it contains; see the C<Cat.Depot> which contains it for that.

A C<Cat.SubdepotSet> has these 3 attributes:

=over

=item C<parent> - C<Cat.DeclNameChain>

This is the fully-qualified name, in the C<dep.(cat|lib|data)> namespace,
of the subdepot's parent subdepot, which is often just the depot itself.

=item C<name> - C<Cat.Name>

This defines the entire function|updater|procedure body, that is its
implementation, besides what C<interface> defines.

=back

plus C<name> attributes.  Its default value is empty.

=head1 TYPES FOR DEFINING PACKAGES

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.Package

A C<Cat.Package> is a C<Tuple>.  It specifies the entire system catalog of
a single package, which provides a privatizing namespace for a subset of a
depot's entities; entities outside a package can only invoke that package's
entities which have been declared part of its public interface.  A package
internally looks like a depot but that it doesn't contain subdepots or
other packages.  The system catalog variable named C<pkg.cat> is of the
C<Cat.Package> type.

=head1 TYPES FOR DEFINING INNER ROUTINE BODIES

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.InnerFuncBody

A C<Cat.InnerFuncBody> is a C<Tuple>.  It specifies the entire body or
implementation of an inner function (or the main body of a function),
besides the details that a C<Cat.FuncHead> has, one of which each
C<Cat.InnerFuncBody> typically must be paired with.

=item C<comment> - C<Cat.Comment>

This is an optional programmer comment about the (|inner )function body.

=item C<expr> - C<Cat.ExprNodeSet>

This defines the value expression tree that comprises the entire (|inner
)function body.

=back

There is a distributed (unique) key over the C<name> attributes of all the
attributes of C<expr>; and if this C<Cat.InnerFuncBody> is paired with a
C<Cat.FuncHead>, then the distributed key also extends over the head's
parameter names.

A C<Cat.InnerFuncBody> specifies a simple value expression tree of named
expression nodes, each of which is a tuple of one of its C<expr.\w+_exprs>
attributes.  It must have at least 1 member node, except that it may have
zero member nodes iff the (|inner )function it is composed into has exactly
1 parameter, in which case the value expression tree implicitly results in
the argument to said parameter.  Otherwise:  All member nodes must define a
simple expression node tree, such that every member except one (which is
the root node) has one of its peers as a parent node, and no direct cycles
between members are permitted (only indirect cycles based on (|inner
)function invocations are allowed); the name of the root node must be the
empty string.  Note that the composed-into (|inner )function's parameters
are also implicitly tree nodes, and are referenced by name into the
expression the same way as any other named expression node is.  Regardless
of whether the node count is zero or 1+, the tree must denote a value
expression whose result type is of the result type of the (|inner )function
it is composed into, and which invokes all of the (|inner )function's
parameters.

The default value of C<Cat.InnerFuncBody> directly corresponds to the
default value of C<Cat.FuncHead> and unconditionally results in the value
C<Bool:false>.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.ExprNodeSet

A C<Cat.ExprNodeSet> is a C<Tuple> that specifies a set of named value
expression nodes.  It is typically composed into a (|inner
)(function|updater). Each tuple of a C<Cat.ExprNodeSet> attribute is a
named expression node, which is the majority component of functional Muldis
D code.  All arbitrarily complex Muldis D expression trees, including
relational queries, are composed of just expression nodes, either directly,
or indirectly by way of (|inner )function invocations, as each (|inner
)function body is itself composed entirely of a single expression tree (of
at least 1 node).  Only functions and updaters may contain expression
nodes, so for any procedures that would conceptually include them, those
portions of the procedures need to be separated out and encapsulated by
named (|inner )functions or (|inner )updaters.  Note that, while the
general case has expression trees simply denoting a value, in some cases
they may instead define a pseudo-variable / virtual variable; that only
happens in (|inner )updaters where the expression is used as an argument
for a subject-to-update parameter of an (|inner )update operator call; in
that case the leaf nodes / only node of the expression must map to a
subject-to-update parameter of the containing (|inner )update operator.

=over

=item C<sca_lit_exprs> - C<Cat.ScaLitExprNodeSet>

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.MultiUpdStmt

A C<Cat.MultiUpdStmt> is a C<Relation> that specifies a multi-update

arbitrarily complex Muldis D value assignments, including relational

C<Cat.MultiUpdStmt>, so for any procedures that would conceptually include
them, those portions of the procedures need to be separated out and

C<upd_args> is binding to a subject-to-update parameter, the expression
tree actually is defining a pseudo-variable / virtual-variable over 1..N
containing routine subject-to-update parameters; in the most trivial (and
common) case, the parameter is referenced directly.

=item C<ro_args> - C<Cat.NameExprMap>

These are the 0..N read-only arguments to the (|inner )updater invocation.
Each element defines one argument value, with the element C<name> matching

=head1 SIMPLE GENERIC CATALOG COLLECTION TYPES

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.NameTypeMap

A C<Cat.NameTypeMap> is a C<Relation>.  It defines a basic component list,
meaning a set of names, with a declared data type name for each.  It forms
the foundation for most componentized type definitions, including all tuple
and relation types (for which it is named I<heading>), and it is used also
for the components list of a scalar possrep.  It is also used to define
parameter lists for routines.  A C<Cat.NameTypeMap> has 2 attributes,
C<name> (a C<Cat.Name>) and C<type> (a C<Cat.NameChain>); the C<name> is
the declared name of the attribute or parameter, and comprises a unary key;
the C<type> is the declared data type of the attribute or parameter.  Its
default value has zero tuples.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.NameExprMap

A C<Cat.NameExprMap> is a C<Relation>.  It defines a basic component-values
list, meaning a set of names, with a declared local expression node (or
parameter or variable) name for each.  It is used to define collection
literals; one C<Cat.NameExprMap> defines a whole C<Tuple> value.  It is
also used to define argument lists for routine invocations.  A
C<Cat.NameExprMap> has 2 attributes, C<name> (a C<Cat.Name>) and C<expr> (a
C<Cat.NameChain>); the C<name> is the name of the tuple/etc attribute or
routine argument, and comprises a unary key; the C<expr> is the declared
local name of the expression node (or parameter or variable) which defines
the value for the attribute or argument.  Note that while the C<expr>
attribute could conceivably just be a C<Cat.Name> because most of its
allowed values would be in the C<lex> namespace, the C<Cat.NameChain> is
used instead so that value expressions can take advantage of terse syntax
for addressing value attributes.  Its default value has zero tuples.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.AttrRenameMap

A C<Cat.AttrRenameMap> is a C<Relation>.  It is used as a specification for
how to rename attributes of some collection.  A C<Cat.AttrRenameMap> has 2

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.E_TK

A C<Cat.E_TK> (type kind) is a scalar enumeration consisting of the 8
values C<Cat.E_TK:special> (mainly for system-defined implicit supertypes),
C<Cat.E_TK:scalar>, C<Cat.E_TK:tuple>, C<Cat.E_TK:relation>,
C<Cat.E_TK:quasi_scalar>, C<Cat.E_TK:quasi_tuple>,
C<Cat.E_TK:quasi_relation>, C<Cat.E_TK:remnant>.  Its default value is
C<Cat.E_TK:scalar>.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.E_TDM

A C<Cat.E_TDM> (type definition method) is a scalar enumeration consisting
of the 9 values C<Cat.E_TDM:special> (for some system-defined types that
don't best fit in other categories, and all parameterized types; users can
not define the latter for now), C<Cat.E_TDM:root> (complete root type
defined in terms of explicit attribute collection; all are fully defined,
not parameterized), C<Cat.E_TDM:restriction> (defined as "explicit
other-type where condition"), C<Cat.E_TDM:alias> (so the same one type can
have multiple names), C<Cat.E_TDM:(union|intersection|exclusion)> (defined
as explicit union|intersection|exclusion of other types),
C<Cat.E_TDM:difference> (defined as explicit difference of 2 other types),
C<Cat.E_TDM:negation> (defined as explicit negation of another type).  Its
default value is C<Cat.E_TDM:alias>.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.Type

A C<Cat.Type> is a C<Tuple>.  It defines a data type, which can either be
(sometimes) invoked directly for values, or be invoked by or embedded into
other type definitions.  C<Cat.Type> is used in the catalogs for defining
both system and user types (just the interfaces in the former case).

I<TODO:  The catalog types for type definitions need an overhaul.>

A C<Cat.Type> has these 8 attributes:

=over

=item C<tk> - C<Cat.E_TK>

This broadly declares what kind of type this is (eg,
scalar|tuple|relation); it partially says how to interpret the rest of the
attributes and/or which of them have significant values.

=item C<tdm> - C<Cat.E_TDM>

This is the type definition method for the type; it partially says how to
interpret the rest of the attributes and/or which of them have significant
values.  If C<tk> is C<Cat.E_TK:special>, then C<tdm> must be
C<Cat.E_TDM:special>; C<tdm> can be special at other times too.

=item C<types> - C<Cat.SetOfNameChain>

For some values of C<tdm>, the data type is defined at least partially in
terms of other data types not by way of attribute definitions, and then
C<types> lists all/most of those types.  Iff C<tdm> is C<Cat.E_TDM:alias>,
then the data type is just a symbolic reference for some other data type
(as far as the type system is concerned, they are the same data type,
invokable by an extra name), and C<types> has one element that is the name
of that type.  Iff C<tdm> is C<Cat.E_TDM:restriction>, then the data type
is defined as an explicit subtype of another type by way of an explicit
further type constraint applied to it, and C<types> has one element that is
the name of that supertype.  Iff C<tdm> is
C<Cat.E_TDM:(union|intersection|exclusion)>, then the data type is defined
as an explicit union|intersection|exclusion of N other types, and C<types>
lists their names, one per element; 2+ elements is the norm; just 1 element
means that the data type is a simple alias for the named element; zero
elements means the data type is a simple alias for, respectively, the type
C<Empty>, C<Universal>, or C<Empty>.  Iff C<tdm> is
C<Cat.E_TDM.difference>, then the data type is defined as the difference of
2 other types, and C<types> has one element that is the name of the minuend
type.  Iff C<tdm> is C<Cat.E_TDM.negation>, then the data type is defined
as the negation of some other type, and C<types> has one element that is
the name of that type.

=item C<subtr_type> - C<Cat.NameChain>

Iff C<tdm> is C<Cat.E_TDM.difference>, then the data type is defined as the
difference of 2 other types, and C<subtr_type> is the name of the
subtrahend type.

=item C<attrs> - C<Cat.NameTypeMap>

Iff C<tdm> is C<Cat.E_TDM:root>, then the data type is defined
fundamentally in terms of an explicit attribute collection, and C<attrs>
defines the names and declared types of those attributes.  Iff additionally
C<tk> is C<Cat.E_TK:(scalar|quasi_scalar)>, then C<attrs> specifically
defines the attributes of just the core/initial/only possrep; otherwise,
C<attrs> defines the heading of the tuple or relation etc type.  It is
valid to have zero attributes; in this case, the type consists of exactly
one value.

=item C<keys> - C<Cat.SetOfSetOfName>

Iff C<tk> is C<Cat.E_TK:(relation|quasi_relation)> and C<tdm> is not
C<Cat.E_TDM:special>, then the data type is or resembles a relation type
and can have explicit keys (duality of unique key constraints and terser
unique identifiers for the q/relation's member q/tuples) defined over its
attributes, and C<keys> defines those keys in the canonical simplest form
(in contrast with using C<constraint> instead).  Each element of C<keys>
defines one key of the q/relation, and that element is a set of the
attribute names comprising that key.  For q/relation types, if no keys are
explicitly defined, then it implicitly has a single key comprising all of
its attributes.  If any explicit keys are defined, then every one must be
over a distinct proper subset of the type's attributes, and moreover no
key's attributes may be a proper subset of any other key's attributes; if 2
such candidates appear, just use the one that has the subset.  It is valid
for a key to consist of zero attributes; in this case, that key is the only
key of the q/relation type, and values of the type may each consist of no
more than one tuple.

=item C<constraint> - C<Cat.TypeConstraint> ... default one always res True

Iff C<tdm> is C<Cat.E_TDM:root>, then the data type is defined
fundamentally in terms of an explicit attribute collection, and
C<constraint> defines/names a generalized type constraint that validates
the collection as a whole.  Iff C<tdm> is C<Cat.E_TDM:restriction>, then
the data type is defined as an explicit subtype of another type by way of
an explicit further type constraint applied to it, and C<constraint>
defines/names that further constraint.

=item C<comment> - C<Cat.Comment>

This is an optional programmer comment about the data type.

=back

The default value of C<Cat.Type> is an alias of C<Empty>.

I<TODO.>

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.SetOfSetOfName

A C<Cat.SetOfSetOfName> is a C<Set> whose C<value> attribute has a declared
type of C<Cat.SetOfName>.

=head2 sys.Core.Type.Cat.SetOfNameChain

A C<Cat.SetOfNameChain> is a C<Set> whose C<value> attribute has a declared
type of C<Cat.NameChain>.

=head1 SYSTEM-DEFINED CORE QUASI-CATALOG PARAMETERIZED TYPES

These types are incomplete proper subtypes of other core incomplete types,
and generally speaking their sole purpose is to be the declared data types
of several system-defined N-ary tuple|relation operator parameters which
are collections of generic nonscalar values.  They are called quasi-catalog
because they are not generally expected to be used for user data, but they
also are not used to compose the system catalog either.

=item C<sys.Core.Type.QuasiCat.(Set|Bag)Of(Tuple|Relation)>

A C<(Set|Bag)OfRelation> is an incompletely defined proper subtype of
C<Set|Bag> whose C<value> attribute has a declared type of a
C<Tuple|Relation> subtype; this is the parameter type of several N-ary
relational operators.

=item C<sys.Core.Type.QuasiCat.SetOfBag>

A C<SetOfBag> is an incompletely defined proper subtype of C<Set> whose
C<value> attribute has a declared type of a C<Bag> subtype; this is the
parameter type of several N-ary relational operators that work with C<Bag>
values.

=item C<sys.Core.Type.QuasiCat.MaybeOfTuple>

A C<MaybeOfTuple> is an incompletely defined proper subtype of C<Maybe>
whose C<value> attribute has a declared type of a C<Tuple> subtype; this is
the parameter type of the C<sys.Nonscalar.Relation.maybe_reduction>
operator.

=item C<sys.Core.Type.QuasiCat.SeqOfSeq>

A C<SeqOfSeq> is an incompletely defined proper subtype of C<Seq> whose
C<value> attribute has a declared type of a C<Seq> subtype; this is the
parameter type of the N-ary C<sys.Sequence.catenation> operator.

=item C<sys.Core.Type.QuasiCat.QuasiSetOf(Tuple|Relation)>

A C<QuasiSetOfRelation> is an incompletely defined proper subtype of
C<QuasiSet> whose C<value> attribute has a declared type of
C<Tuple|Relation>; these are the parameter types of the N-ary
C<sys.Core.Tuple.product> and C<sys.Core.Relation.(join|product)>
operators.
