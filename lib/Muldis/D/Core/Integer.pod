=head1 NAME

Muldis::D::Core::Integer -
Muldis D integer numeric operators

=head1 VERSION

This document is Muldis::D::Core::Integer version 0.112.0.

=head1 PREFACE

This document is part of the Muldis D language specification, whose root
document is L<Muldis::D>; you should read that root document before
you read this one, which provides subservient details.  Moreover, you
should read the L<Muldis::D::Core> document before this current
document, as that forms its own tree beneath a root document branch.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes essentially all of the core Muldis D operators that
are specific to the core data type C<Int>, essentially all the generic ones
that a typical programming language should have.

I<This documentation is pending.>

=head1 FUNCTIONS FOR INTEGER MATH

These functions implement commonly used integer numeric operations.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.succ

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.succ (Int <-- $topic : Int) >>

This function results in the value that succeeds its argument.  Note that
this operation is also known as C<++>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.pred

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.pred (Int <-- $topic : Int) >>

This function results in the value that precedes its argument.  Note that
this operation is also known as C<-->.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.abs

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.abs (NNInt <-- $topic : Int) >>

This function results in the absolute value of its argument.  Note that
this operation is also known as C<I||>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.sum

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.sum (Int <-- $topic? : bag_of.Int) >>

This function results in the sum of the N element values of its argument;
it is a reduction operator that recursively takes each pair of input values
and adds (which is both commutative and associative) them together until
just one is left, which is the result.  If C<topic> has zero values, then
C<sum> results in the integer zero, which is the identity value for
addition.  Note that this operation is also known as I<addition> or I<plus>
or C<I+>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.diff

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.diff (Int <-- $minuend : Int,
$subtrahend : Int) >>

This function results in the difference when its C<subtrahend> argument is
subtracted from its C<minuend> argument.  Note that this operation is also
known as I<subtraction> or I<minus> or C<I->.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.abs_diff

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.abs_diff (Int <-- $topic : Int,
$other : Int) >>

This symmetric function results in the absolute difference between its 2
arguments.  Note that this operation is also known as C<I|-|>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.product

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.product (Int <-- $topic? : bag_of.Int) >>

This function results in the product of the N element values of its
argument; it is a reduction operator that recursively takes each pair of
input values and multiplies (which is both commutative and associative)
them together until just one is left, which is the result.  If C<topic>
has zero values, then C<product> results in the integer 1, which is the
identity value for multiplication.  Note that this operation is also known
as I<multiply> or I<times> or C<I*>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.quotient

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.quotient (Int <-- $dividend : Int,
$divisor : Int, $round_meth : RoundMeth) >>

This function results in the quotient when its C<dividend> argument is
divided by its C<divisor> argument using integer division.  The semantics
of this function are equivalent to rounding the result of a real number
division to the same or nearest integer, where the nearest is determined by
the rounding method specified by the C<round_meth> argument; C<round_meth>
is optional and defaults to C<HalfEven> if not given.  This function
will fail if C<divisor> is zero.  Note that this operation is also known as
I<divide> or C<I/>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.remainder

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.remainder (NNInt <-- $dividend : Int,
$divisor : Int, $round_meth : RoundMeth) >>

This function results in the remainder when its C<dividend> argument is
divided by its C<divisor> argument using integer division.  The semantics
of this function preserve the identity C<$x % $y = $x - $y * ($x / $y)>
(read C<$x> as C<dividend> and C<$y> as C<divisor>) where the division C</>
has the same semantics as C<sys.std.Core.Integer.quotient> (rounding the
result of a real number division as per C<round_meth>); the sign of this
function's result always matches the sign of the dividend or the divisor if
C<round_meth> is C<ToZero> or C<ToFloor>, respectively.  This function
will fail if C<divisor> is zero.  Note that this operation is also known as
I<modulus> or C<%>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.quot_and_rem

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.quot_and_rem (Tuple <--
$dividend : Int, $divisor : Int, $round_meth : RoundMeth) >>

This function results in a binary tuple whose attribute names are
C<quotient> (an C<Int>) and C<remainder> (a C<NNInt>) and whose respective
attribute values are what C<sys.std.Core.Integer.quotient> and
C<sys.std.Core.Integer.remainder> would result in when given the same
arguments.  This function will fail if C<divisor> is zero.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.maybe_quotient

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.maybe_quotient (maybe_of.Int <--
$dividend : Int, $divisor : Int, $round_meth : RoundMeth) >>

This function is exactly the same as C<sys.std.Core.Integer.quotient>
except that it results in a C<Maybe> of what is otherwise the result, and
that result has zero elements if C<divisor> is zero.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.maybe_remainder

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.maybe_remainder (maybe_of.NNInt <--
$dividend : Int, $divisor : Int, $round_meth : RoundMeth) >>

This function is exactly the same as C<sys.std.Core.Integer.remainder>
except that it results in a C<Maybe> of what is otherwise the result, and
that result has zero elements if C<divisor> is zero.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.maybe_quot_and_rem

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.maybe_quot_and_rem (Relation <--
$dividend : Int, $divisor : Int, $round_meth : RoundMeth) >>

This function results in a binary relation whose attribute names are
C<quotient> (an C<Int>) and C<remainder> (a C<NNInt>).  If C<divisor> is
nonzero then the result has a single tuple whose respective attribute
values are what C<sys.std.Core.Integer.quotient> and
C<sys.std.Core.Integer.remainder> would result in when given the same
arguments; if C<divisor> is zero, then the result has zero tuples.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.range

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.range (Int <-- $topic : set_of.Int) >>

This function results in the difference between the lowest and highest
element values of its argument.  If C<topic> has zero values, then C<range>
results in the integer zero.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.mean

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.mean (Int <-- $topic : bag_of.Int,
$round_meth : RoundMeth) >>

This function results in the mean or arithmetic average of the N element
values of its argument.  It is equivalent to first taking the sum of the
input values, and dividing that sum by the count of the input values, where
the semantics of the division are the same as those of
C<sys.std.Core.Integer.quotient> (rounding the result of a real number
division as per C<round_meth>).  If
C<topic> has zero values, then this function will fail.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.maybe_mean

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.maybe_mean (maybe_of.Int <--
$topic : bag_of.Int, $round_meth : RoundMeth) >>

This function is exactly the same as C<sys.std.Core.Integer.mean> except
that it results in a C<Maybe> of what is otherwise the result, and that
result has zero elements if C<topic> has zero values.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.median

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.median (set_of.Int <--
$topic : bag_of.Int) >>

This function results in the 1 or 2 median values of the N element values
of its argument; they are returned as a set.  It is equivalent to first
arranging the input values from least to greatest, and then taking the
single middle value, if the count of input values is odd, or taking the 2
middle values, if the count of input values is even (but if the 2 middle
values are the same value, the output has one element).  If C<topic> has
zero values, then the result set is empty.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.mean_of_median

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.mean_of_median (Int <--
$topic : bag_of.Int, $round_meth : RoundMeth) >>

This function is a wrapper over C<sys.std.Core.Integer.median> that will
result in the mean of its result elements; it will fail if there are zero
elements.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.mode

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.mode (set_of.Int <-- $topic : bag_of.Int)
>>

This function results in the mode of the N element values of its argument;
it is the set of values that appear the most often as input elements, and
all have the same count of occurrances.  As a trivial case, if all input
elements have the same count of occurrances, then they will all be in the
output.  If C<topic> has zero values, then the result set is empty.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.power

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.power (Int <-- $radix : Int,
$exponent : NNInt) >>

This function results in its C<radix> argument taken to the power of its
(non-negative integer) C<exponent> argument.  This function will result in
1 if C<radix> and C<exponent> are both zero (rather than failing), which
seems reasonable given that the C<Integer.power> function strictly has no
numeric continuity (unlike C<Rational.power>) and that this is by far the
most common practice in both pure integer math contexts and computer
languages, including SQL.  Note that this operation is also known as
I<exponentiation> or C<I^>.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.factorial

C<< function sys.std.Core.Integer.factorial (PInt <-- $topic : NNInt) >>

This function results in the factorial of its argument (it is defined for
an argument of zero to result in 1, as per the identity value for
multiplication of an empty set).  Note that this operation is also known as
C<I!>.

=head1 SYSTEM-SERVICES FOR RANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS

These system-service routines provide ways to get random numbers from the
system.  Where the results are in the range between truly random and
pseudo-random is, for the moment, an implementation detail, but the details
of these functions is subject to become more formalized later.

=head2 sys.std.Core.Integer.fetch_random

C<system-service sys.std.Core.Integer.fetch_random (&$target : Int,
$interval : sp_interval_of.Int)>

This system-service routine will update the variable supplied as its
C<target> argument so that it holds a randomly generated integer value that
is included within the interval defined by its C<interval> argument.  This
function will fail if C<interval> represents an empty interval.
